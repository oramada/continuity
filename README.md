Continuity Protocol is a developer-preview implementation of the Trust Signature Layer (TSL): a protocol for portable trust evidence, signed claims, Merkle-backed receipts, verifier APIs, settlement evidence, and conformance-tested protocol objects.

This repository is public-launch ready as a developer preview. It is not production-ready, not audited, and not approved for mainnet use.

## What Works Today

- Canonical JSON bytes, domain-separated hashes, Ed25519 signatures, and deterministic test vectors.
- Identity, event, receipt, attestation, revocation, checkpoint, proof bundle, and verifier schema validation.
- Merkle inclusion and non-membership proofs.
- TypeScript core verifier, CLI demo, service wrappers, web verifier bundle, Python/Rust parity checks, Solidity contracts, and Hardhat local deployment.
- Production-interface ZK circuits and conformance gates for ZK and offline settlement proof behavior.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Node.js 20+, npm, Docker for the full release check, and Python 3.11 for parity checks.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/omar2001ramadan/contin.git
cd contin
npm ci
npm run demo
```

Expected demo output includes a deterministic proof bundle and:

```json
"verified": true
```

Run the public launch gate:

```bash
npm run release:check
```

Optional local service stack:

```bash
docker compose up
```

See [docs/QUICKSTART.md](docs/QUICKSTART.md) for the longer path and expected checks.

## Maturity Map

| Area | Status |
| --- | --- |
| Canonicalization, signatures, commitments, Merkle proofs | Developer-preview stable |
| Core verifier, proof bundles, schema validation | Developer-preview stable |
| CLI demo, local services, web verifier | Developer-preview |
| Scoring, graph features, Sybil and drift analysis | Experimental |
| Production ZK circuits and manifests | Candidate pipeline only |
| Offline settlement proof | Implemented and vector-tested locally |
| Mainnet operation and public risk labels | Not production-ready |

## Safety Warnings

- Do not use this repository for production identity, legal trust, financial risk scoring, irreversible negative claims, or mainnet settlement.
- The project has not completed external security or ZK audit.
- `conformance:mainnet` is intentionally evidence-gated and should remain blocked until real ceremony, audit, deployment, legal, security, ops, governance, and release approvals exist.
- Docker Compose and example environment files use public dev-only Hardhat keys and local passwords.
