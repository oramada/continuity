]
The Trust Signature Layer (\TSL) is a transport-independent trust envelope protocol for online communication, transactions, and autonomous agents. It is not an application that users join and it is not a social network, inbox, marketplace, wallet, or advertising surface. It allows any message, transaction, API call, or agent action to carry a cryptographic proof of origin, continuity, and revocation status without exposing private content by default. Instead of forcing every platform to build its own identity, reputation, and anti-fraud stack, \TSL{} moves trust beneath application semantics and above ordinary transport delivery. Applications become carriers of signed envelopes and proof links; the canonical trust state lives in cryptographic identities, co-signed receipts, append-only transparency logs, and blockchain-anchored checkpoints.

The protocol's core primitive is \PoC: a hard-to-fake record of behavioral and cryptographic continuity over time. In a world where generative AI can cheaply produce fake profiles, fake credentials, fake messages, fake social graphs, and fake agents, the scarce resource becomes not identity, but durable, organic, verifiable trajectory. \TSL{} is designed to become the trust substrate for email, messaging, marketplaces, wallets, professional networks, customer support, open-source ecosystems, and AI-agent communication.

\section{The One-Line Pitch}
% ============================================================

\begin{thesisbox}
\TSL{} is the universal trust layer for the AI internet: a protocol that lets any identity, human, business, wallet, or agent prove cryptographic continuity across apps without revealing private messages.
\end{thesisbox}

\begin{principlebox}{Protocol, Not Application}
\TSL{} is not an application that users sign up for, browse, advertise on, or use as a destination. It is a protocol layer and trust-envelope standard that can be embedded beneath existing applications and above transport delivery. Web interfaces, browser extensions, wallets, dashboards, SDKs, and command-line tools are only reference clients for creating, carrying, resolving, and verifying \TSL{} proofs.
\end{principlebox}

The product does not ask the world to join another social network. It does not ask every company to rip out its communication stack. It does not require a new inbox, a new marketplace, or a new identity provider.

Instead, \TSL{} says:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Keep every app. Add a trust settlement layer beneath them.}
\end{quote}

Every application can carry a \TSL{} envelope. Every envelope can be verified. Every verified event can become part of a privacy-preserving continuity graph. Every continuity graph can be scored, audited, challenged, and selectively disclosed.

\begin{principlebox}{The Core Belief}
AI makes content cheap. Blockchain makes records durable. Graphs make behavior legible. The next internet trust primitive is \textbf{Proof of Continuity}.
\end{principlebox}

% ============================================================
\section{Why Now}
% ============================================================

The internet is entering a phase where the cost of manufacturing convincing identity signals is collapsing.

A malicious actor can now generate:

\begin{itemize}
    \item realistic profile pictures,
    \item polished bios,
    \item credible writing styles,
    \item fake resumes and credentials,
    \item synthetic references,
    \item cloned voices,
    \item fake customer support agents,
    \item fake sellers and buyers,
    \item fake software maintainers,
    \item fake AI agents,
    \item fake communities of accounts that vouch for each other.
\end{itemize}

The old trust stack was built for a slower internet:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Old Primitive & Failure Mode in the AI Internet \\
\midrule
Username & Easy to impersonate or imitate \\
Profile picture & AI-generated or stolen \\
Verified badge & Platform-specific, often pay-to-play or policy-dependent \\
Email domain & Spoofable, compromised, or unfamiliar to users \\
Password login & Authenticates access, not trustworthiness \\
KYC & Expensive, invasive, not useful for pseudonymous ecosystems \\
Platform reputation & Trapped in silos; disappears when users change platforms \\
One-time credential & Says little about current behavior or compromise \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

The coming internet requires a different primitive:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Can this identity prove a durable, hard-to-fake pattern of signed behavior over time?}
\end{quote}

\TSL{} is the answer.

% ============================================================
\section{The Category: Trust Settlement}
% ============================================================

Payments have settlement networks. Cloud has infrastructure layers. Identity has authentication providers. Communication has no equivalent trust settlement layer.

Today, every application tries to solve trust locally:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Gmail fights phishing inside Gmail.
    \item LinkedIn fights fake profiles inside LinkedIn.
    \item Marketplaces score sellers inside their marketplace.
    \item Wallets warn about scams inside wallet UX.
    \item AI platforms try to authenticate agents inside their own ecosystem.
\end{itemize}

This creates duplicated effort, weak portability, and fragmented trust.

\TSL{} introduces a new category:

\begin{principlebox}{Trust Settlement}
Trust settlement is the process by which claims about identity continuity, key validity, revocation, interaction history, attestations, and risk assessments become portable, verifiable, and independent of any single application.
\end{principlebox}

The protocol does for communication trust what payment rails did for commerce:

\begin{itemize}
    \item applications initiate interactions,
    \item the trust layer settles continuity,
    \item verifiers check proofs,
    \item users retain portability,
    \item no single app owns the canonical trust history.
\end{itemize}

% ============================================================
\section{Design Goal: Below the Application Layer}
% ============================================================

The most important architectural decision is that \TSL{} should not become an integrations company. It should become a protocol company.

\begin{warningbox}{Wrong Architecture}
Build one custom integration for Gmail, another for Discord, another for LinkedIn, another for X, another for Slack, another for marketplaces, and another for agent frameworks. Each app becomes a special case.
\end{warningbox}

\begin{principlebox}{Right Architecture}
Make applications dumb carriers. The protocol should only require that a message, transaction, or agent action can carry a signed envelope or proof link. Identity, signatures, receipts, revocations, attestations, checkpoints, and verification live below the app.
\end{principlebox}

The application layer should answer:

\begin{quote}
How do I deliver this message or action?
\end{quote}

The \TSL{} layer should answer:

\begin{quote}
Who signed this? Is the key valid? Was the event committed? Has the identity been revoked? Does the interaction fit a trustworthy continuity pattern? What proof can be shown without exposing private content?
\end{quote}


% ============================================================
\section{Layer Placement: Below Applications, Above Transport}
% ============================================================

\TSL{} should be understood as a trust-envelope layer, not as a replacement for TCP, TLS, HTTP, SMTP, QUIC, or any specific application protocol. It does not deliver packets. It does not own the user interface. It does not require users to visit a new destination. It attaches verifiable trust semantics to messages and actions that are already moving through existing transports.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.28\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Layer & Role \\
\midrule
Application semantics & Email, chat, marketplace messages, wallet actions, API calls, support tickets, code releases, and AI-agent tool calls. \\
\TSL{} trust-envelope layer & Signed event commitments, \TrustID{} resolution, receipts, revocation checks, inclusion proofs, checkpoint verification, and optional signed trust assessments. \\
Transport and security layer & HTTPS, TLS, QUIC, TCP/IP, SMTP, WebSockets, message queues, and other delivery mechanisms. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\begin{principlebox}{No Signup Destination}
The adoption goal is not to bring users into a new app. The adoption goal is to make existing applications and agents carry verifiable trust envelopes. In the mature version, \TSL{} should feel like TLS for trust: mostly invisible when present, obvious when missing, and independently verifiable when challenged.
\end{principlebox}

A typical flow is:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
user or agent creates ordinary message/action
  -> TSL client or SDK creates commitment
  -> TSL active key signs commitment
  -> envelope or proof link is attached to the message/action
  -> message travels over existing transport
  -> recipient verifier checks signature, key state, revocation, log inclusion, and checkpoint
  -> recipient sees continuity status and explanation
\end{lstlisting}

The key separation is simple:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.27\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Layer & Responsibility \\
\midrule
Application layer & Delivers messages, transactions, and agent calls \\
Client layer & Signs, verifies, stores private context, and renders trust UX \\
Relay/log layer & Batches commitments and provides inclusion proofs \\
Blockchain layer & Settles identity, revocation, checkpoints, attestations, and provider state \\
AI/graph layer & Estimates behavioral risk from local, disclosed, and aggregate evidence \\
Governance layer & Defines protocol upgrades, provider rules, appeals, and abuse controls \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

% ============================================================
\section{Core Primitive: Proof of Continuity}
% ============================================================

\PoC{} is not a single score. It is a bundle of verifiable signals:

\begin{itemize}
    \item continuity of cryptographic keys,
    \item continuity of signed event history,
    \item continuity of counterparty receipts,
    \item continuity of graph position,
    \item continuity of attestations,
    \item continuity of behavioral trajectory,
    \item continuity of revocation and recovery state.
\end{itemize}

An identity can have a valid signature but still be risky. A compromised account can sign with a valid key. A bot can sign messages. A scammer can create a keypair. Therefore, \TSL{} separates authentication from trustworthiness.

\begin{warningbox}{Authentication Is Not Trust}
A valid signature proves that a key signed an event. It does not prove that the actor is safe, honest, human, uncompromised, or acting in good faith.
\end{warningbox}

The protocol's thesis is:

\begin{equation}
\text{Trust} \approx \text{valid origin} + \text{durable continuity} + \text{organic graph position} + \text{low adversarial similarity}.
\end{equation}

% ============================================================
\section{Canonical Objects}
% ============================================================

\subsection{TrustID}

A \TrustID{} is a portable cryptographic identity. It may represent a person, business, wallet, software package, AI agent, marketplace seller, organization, or pseudonymous account.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.identity.v1",
  "id": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",
  "controller": "smart_account_or_public_key",
  "created_at": "2026-05-25T00:00:00Z",
  "verification_methods": [
    {
      "id": "#device-key-1",
      "type": "ed25519",
      "public_key": "z6Mk...",
      "status": "active"
    }
  ],
  "recovery": {
    "type": "smart_account_recovery",
    "policy_commitment": "0x..."
  },
  "privacy_policy_commitment": "0x..."
}
\end{lstlisting}

The \TrustID{} should be compatible with decentralized identifier patterns, but \TSL{} should not depend on any single DID method. The protocol should expose a resolution abstraction:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
resolveTrustID(id) -> {
  controller,
  active_keys,
  revoked_keys,
  service_endpoints,
  policy_commitments,
  latest_checkpoint
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Event Commitment}

An event commitment is a signed claim that an interaction occurred. The raw message remains private by default.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.event_commitment.v1",
  "event_class": "message | transaction | attestation | agent_call | code_release",
  "sender": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",
  "receiver_commitment": "H(receiver_id || receiver_salt)",
  "content_commitment": "H(domain || content_hash || content_salt)",
  "metadata_commitment": "H(private_metadata || metadata_salt)",
  "previous_event_commitment": "optional_hash",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-25T00:01:00Z",
  "nonce": "random_256_bit_nonce",
  "disclosure_policy": "commitment_only",
  "signature": "sender_signature_over_canonical_payload"
}
\end{lstlisting}

The protocol should not make \texttt{platform} a required public field. Platform-specific metadata should be private, optional, or selectively disclosed. This avoids turning the protocol into an app-by-app integration system.

\subsection{Receipt Commitment}

Receipts turn unilateral claims into mutually observed interactions.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.receipt_commitment.v1",
  "event_commitment": "H(tsl.event_commitment.v1)",
  "receiver": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xdef...",
  "receipt_class": "received | replied | transacted | completed | disputed",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-25T00:02:00Z",
  "metadata_commitment": "H(private_receipt_metadata || salt)",
  "signature": "receiver_signature_over_receipt"
}
\end{lstlisting}

A single-signed event proves origin. A co-signed receipt proves interaction. A long history of diverse reciprocal receipts is much harder to fake than a static profile.

\subsection{Attestation}

An attestation is a signed claim by one identity about another.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.attestation.v1",
  "issuer": "did:tsl:org:trusted-provider",
  "subject": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",
  "attestation_class": "known_business | verified_maintainer | trusted_counterparty | scam_warning | org_member",
  "claim_commitment": "H(claim_body || salt)",
  "visibility": "public | selective | private",
  "issued_at": "2026-05-25T00:03:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-11-25T00:03:00Z",
  "signature": "issuer_signature"
}
\end{lstlisting}

Negative attestations require strict abuse controls: rate limits, evidence commitments, appeal channels, issuer accountability, and separation between warnings and definitive claims.

\subsection{Revocation Event}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.revocation.v1",
  "trust_id": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",
  "revoked_key": "z6MkOld...",
  "replacement_key": "z6MkNew...",
  "reason_class": "rotation | compromise | device_loss | policy_update",
  "effective_at": "2026-05-25T00:04:00Z",
  "signature": "controller_or_recovery_signature"
}
\end{lstlisting}

Revocation is not an implementation detail. It is central to trust. Without strong revocation, a long-lived identity becomes a long-lived liability.

\subsection{Batch Checkpoint}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.batch_checkpoint.v1",
  "epoch": "2026-05-25T00:00:00Z/PT5M",
  "shard": "identity_prefix_00af",
  "event_root": "0x...",
  "receipt_root": "0x...",
  "attestation_root": "0x...",
  "revocation_root": "0x...",
  "event_count": 148292,
  "receipt_count": 93301,
  "previous_checkpoint": "0x...",
  "settlement_backend": "eip155:8453",
  "settlement_tx": "0x...",
  "relay_signature": "0x..."
}
\end{lstlisting}

% ============================================================
\section{What Goes On-Chain}
% ============================================================

The blockchain is the settlement and control plane. It is not the database of private communications.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.30\textwidth} X}
\toprule
On-chain & Off-chain / Local \\
\midrule
TrustID registry & Raw messages \\
Current public keys & Attachments and media \\
Key rotation records & Exact private contact lists \\
Revocation records & Sensitive metadata \\
Checkpoint roots & Full event payloads \\
Attestation roots & Full communication graph \\
Scoring-provider registry & Feature vectors if not disclosed \\
Model-version registry & Local risk computation inputs \\
Appeal/governance hooks & Private user settings \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}



\subsection{Normative Data-Placement Scope}

Because provider, model, and governance registries may exist on-chain, implementations MUST keep a strict data-placement boundary. The blockchain stores control-plane facts and commitments, not private evidence.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Placement & Allowed Data \\
\midrule
On-chain & Registry identifiers, active-key commitments, revocation state, checkpoint roots, attestation roots, provider IDs, model-card commitments, evaluation-report commitments, governance-policy commitments, and settlement timestamps. \\
Off-chain public & Proof bundles, transparency-log entries, inclusion proofs, schemas, public model cards, public evaluation reports, public audit findings, and public governance policies. \\
Local/private & Raw messages, salts, exact counterparties, private metadata, local relationship labels, private graph, private feature vectors, private notes, and undisclosed consent records. \\
Never on-chain & Raw content, exact private graph, private salts, protected attributes, IP addresses, user-agent fingerprints, precise location, biometric data, and private disclosure-consent contents. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

If an implementation needs to reference private evidence from a public or on-chain object, it MUST use a salted commitment, Merkle root, accumulator commitment, encrypted pointer, or zero-knowledge proof. It MUST NOT publish the private evidence itself.

The chain should answer:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Who controls this \TrustID{}?
    \item Which keys are currently valid?
    \item Was this key revoked?
    \item Was this batch checkpoint committed before time \(T\)?
    \item Which attestation root was active?
    \item Which scoring provider signed this risk assessment?
    \item Which model version produced this assessment?
\end{itemize}

The chain should not answer:

\begin{itemize}
    \item What did the message say?
    \item Who exactly talked to whom?
    \item What is a user's full contact graph?
    \item What are the user's private behavioral features?
\end{itemize}

% ============================================================
\section{Ledger Architecture}
% ============================================================

\subsection{MVP: Transparency Log with Periodic Anchors}

The first production-grade version should use an append-only transparency log with periodic blockchain anchoring.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
client signs event
  -> relay receives event commitment
  -> relay appends commitment to sharded Merkle log
  -> relay returns inclusion promise
  -> checkpoint root is periodically anchored on-chain
  -> verifier checks Merkle inclusion + chain checkpoint + key state
\end{lstlisting}

This architecture gives low cost, high throughput, and public auditability.

\subsection{Production: Sharded Log Mesh}

At scale, one global log is not enough. Use sharded logs by epoch and identity prefix.

\begin{equation}
\text{shard}(i,t) = \hash(\TrustID_i)_{[0:k]} \parallel \text{epoch}(t).
\end{equation}

Each shard maintains:

\begin{itemize}
    \item event commitment tree,
    \item receipt commitment tree,
    \item attestation commitment tree,
    \item revocation tree,
    \item checkpoint chain,
    \item consistency proofs.
\end{itemize}

The verifier only needs the relevant shard proof, not the entire network history.

\subsection{Scale Path: App-Rollup}

When volume grows, \TSL{} should become its own application-specific rollup or trust-settlement network.

\caption{Long-term scale path: \TSL{} app-rollup or trust-settlement network.}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Multi-Backend Verification}

The product should not expose chain complexity to users. A verifier should call one function:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
verifyCommitment(event_commitment, proof, checkpoint) -> VerificationResult
\end{lstlisting}

Internally, the checkpoint may settle to an Ethereum L2, a \TSL{} rollup, another chain, or a timestamping backend. The app should not care.

% ============================================================
\section{No-Integration Distribution}
% ============================================================

No-integration distribution means \TSL{} can propagate through existing channels before platforms add native support. The protocol should succeed first as an envelope, proof link, SDK, and verifier, not as a new place users must visit.


The protocol should work even when platforms do nothing.

\subsection{Proof Links}

Any message can carry a proof link:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
https://verify.tsl.network/p/bafy...
tsl://proof/bafy.../event
\end{lstlisting}

This is the zero-integration wedge. A user or agent can attach a proof link to email, LinkedIn, Discord, Slack, Telegram, X, GitHub, a marketplace chat, API payload, or agent transcript. The proof link is not a destination product; it is a portable verification artifact.

\subsection{Standard Envelope}

Applications that want native support can embed a standard envelope.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "tsl_envelope": {
    "version": "1.0",
    "event_commitment": "0x...",
    "sender": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",
    "signature": "0x...",
    "proof_uri": "ipfs://...",
    "checkpoint": "0x...",
    "disclosure_policy": "commitment_only"
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Portable Proof Bundle}

A proof link SHOULD resolve to a portable proof bundle. The bundle is the implementation anchor for offline verification, browser-extension rendering, enterprise archival, and third-party audit. A verifier MUST be able to ignore optional members it does not understand while still enforcing the version rules for any object it verifies.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.proof_bundle.v1",
  "bundle_id": "0x...",
  "created_at": "2026-05-26T00:00:00Z",
  "envelope": {"type": "tsl.event_commitment.v1"},
  "proof": {"type": "tsl.inclusion_proof.v1"},
  "checkpoint": {"type": "tsl.batch_checkpoint.v1"},
  "identity": {"type": "tsl.identity.v1"},
  "receipts": [],
  "attestations": [],
  "revocations": [],
  "assessment": null,
  "assessment_v2": null,
  "zk_proofs": [],
  "delegations": [],
  "audit_findings": [],
  "governance_policy": {},
  "redaction_manifest": {
    "raw_content_included": false,
    "exact_counterparties_included": false,
    "metadata_fields_redacted": ["platform", "ip_address", "user_agent"]
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

The bundle MUST NOT include raw content, exact private counterparties, salts, private graph features, or restricted metadata unless the subject or authorized controller has given explicit disclosure consent under the privacy consent rules. The \texttt{redaction\_manifest} is normative for UI and audit: it tells the verifier which fields were intentionally absent, not merely missing.

\subsection{Reference Clients and Interfaces}

Reference clients and protocol interfaces can be:

\begin{itemize}
    \item browser extension,
    \item mobile wallet,
    \item desktop app,
    \item enterprise gateway,
    \item SDK embedded in applications,
    \item AI-agent sidecar,
    \item command-line verifier for developers.
\end{itemize}

The client performs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item key generation,
    \item signing,
    \item local encrypted storage,
    \item envelope detection,
    \item inclusion verification,
    \item revocation checks,
    \item receipt requests,
    \item trust-score rendering,
    \item selective disclosure.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Relay API}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
POST /v1/commitments
GET  /v1/proofs/{commitment}
GET  /v1/proof-bundles/{bundle_id}
POST /v1/receipts
GET  /v1/identity/{trust_id}
GET  /v1/revocation/{trust_id}
POST /v1/attestations
GET  /v1/checkpoints/{epoch}/{shard}
GET  /v1/scoring-profiles/{profile_id}
GET  /v1/model-cards/{model_id}
POST /v1/delegations/verify
POST /v1/verify
\end{lstlisting}

This is how \TSL{} avoids app-by-app sprawl. Every product integrates with the same substrate.

% ============================================================
\section{Identity, Recovery, and Smart Accounts}
% ============================================================

Human users cannot be expected to manage raw private keys perfectly. \TSL{} should support several custody modes:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Mode & Use Case \\
\midrule
Local keypair & Developers, power users, pseudonymous identities \\
Passkey-backed key & Consumer onboarding and device-bound signing \\
Smart account & Recovery, policy, session keys, delegated signing \\
Enterprise account & Organizations, teams, support desks, agent fleets \\
Agent account & Scoped authority for autonomous agents and bots \\
Hardware key & High-value identities and maintainers \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

Smart accounts are especially important because \TSL{} needs:

\begin{itemize}
    \item key rotation without identity loss,
    \item social or institutional recovery,
    \item multi-device signing,
    \item organization-managed subkeys,
    \item scoped agent keys,
    \item delegated session keys,
    \item revocation of compromised devices,
    \item sponsored gas for ordinary users.
\end{itemize}

\begin{principlebox}{Recovery Principle}
A user should be able to lose a device without losing years of continuity. A user should be able to revoke a compromised key without erasing trustworthy history.
\end{principlebox}

% ============================================================
\section{Privacy Model}
% ============================================================

\TSL{} must be private by default. A trust protocol that becomes a surveillance protocol will fail technically, socially, and legally.

\subsection{Privacy Levels}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.18\textwidth} X X}
\toprule
Level & Publicly Visible & Private / Local \\
\midrule
Level 0: Local only & Nothing & Raw messages, metadata, graph, scoring \\
Level 1: Commitments & Hashes, timestamps, signatures, roots & Message content, counterparties, metadata \\
Level 2: Selective proof & Specific disclosed claim & Everything outside the claim \\
Level 3: Aggregate proof & Counts, ranges, thresholds & Exact counterparties and messages \\
Level 4: Public identity & Public attestations and score & Any non-disclosed private context \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Commitments}

For message \(m\), metadata \(\mu\), receiver identity \(r\), and salts \(s_m, s_\mu, s_r\):

\begin{align}
    c_m &= \hash(\text{domain} \parallel m \parallel s_m), \\
    c_\mu &= \hash(\text{metadata-domain} \parallel \mu \parallel s_\mu), \\
    c_r &= \hash(\text{receiver-domain} \parallel r \parallel s_r).
\end{align}

Salting and domain separation prevent common correlation and preimage attacks against predictable content.

\subsection{Selective Disclosure}

A user should be able to prove statements such as:

\begin{itemize}
    \item I have controlled this \TrustID{} for more than two years.
    \item This message belongs to a signed continuity chain.
    \item I have more than 50 reciprocal receipts.
    \item This business key is not revoked.
    \item This agent action was signed under a valid delegation.
    \item This seller has completed more than 100 transactions without disclosing buyer identities.
\end{itemize}



\subsection{Privacy Consent Enforcement Rules}

Privacy policy is not only a statement; it is an implementation gate. A compliant client MUST enforce disclosure consent before exporting proof bundles, uploading feature inputs, or revealing private metadata to a provider.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.25\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Control & Required Behavior \\
\midrule
Consent record & Store a signed or locally encrypted \texttt{tsl.disclosure\_consent.v1} record with subject, verifier, field classes, purpose, expiry, and revocation pointer. \\
Local block & If consent is absent, the client MUST block raw messages, salts, exact counterparties, private notes, protected attributes, IP addresses, user agents, and precise location from leaving local storage. \\
Upload filter & Provider uploads MUST be produced through an allowlist transform, not a denylist transform. Fields not explicitly allowed are omitted. \\
Bundle redaction & Proof bundles MUST include a \texttt{redaction\_manifest} listing omitted sensitive classes and MUST NOT include salts unless the verifier is authorized to open a commitment. \\
User warning & Before disclosure, UX MUST state what will be revealed, to whom, for what purpose, for how long, and whether the disclosure can increase correlation risk. \\
Revocation & A subject MAY revoke future disclosures. Past third-party copies cannot be technically erased, so the UX MUST not imply retroactive deletion. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.disclosure_consent.v1",
  "subject": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",
  "verifier_or_provider": "did:tsl:provider:continuity-labs",
  "allowed_field_classes": ["aggregate_counts", "receipt_thresholds", "attestation_status"],
  "forbidden_field_classes": ["raw_content", "exact_counterparties", "protected_attributes", "ip_address"],
  "purpose": "anti_phishing_assessment",
  "issued_at": "2026-05-26T00:00:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-06-26T00:00:00Z",
  "revocation_pointer": "0x...",
  "signature": "subject_or_controller_signature"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Zero-Knowledge Roadmap}

Later versions can add zero-knowledge proofs for threshold and set-membership claims:

\begin{itemize}
    \item prove age over threshold without revealing exact creation time,
    \item prove reciprocal interaction count without revealing counterparties,
    \item prove membership in a vetted organization without revealing internal records,
    \item prove absence from a revocation set,
    \item prove distance from known malicious clusters using privacy-preserving approximations,
    \item prove an agent operated within delegated scope.
\end{itemize}

% ============================================================
\section{Trust Graph and Behavioral Geometry}
% ============================================================

Let \(G_t = (V_t, E_t)\) be the communication and receipt graph at time \(t\). Nodes are \TrustID{}s. Edges are signed events, co-signed receipts, attestations, transactions, or agent calls.

Each identity has a behavioral history:

\begin{equation}
H_i(t) = \{e_{i,1}, e_{i,2}, \ldots, e_{i,n(t)}\}.
\end{equation}

A feature extractor maps the identity, graph, and history into a latent vector:

\begin{equation}
    x_i(t) = \phi(v_i, G_t, H_i(t), A_i(t), R_i(t)),
\end{equation}

where \(A_i(t)\) is the attestation set and \(R_i(t)\) is revocation/recovery state.

\subsection{Feature Families}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Feature Family & Example Signals \\
\midrule
Cryptographic & valid signatures, key age, rotations, revocations, delegation scope \\
Temporal & account age, activity cadence, burstiness, dormant reactivation, response latency \\
Graph & degree, reciprocity, clustering, PageRank, trusted-neighbor ratio, community diversity \\
Receipts & co-signed interactions, completed transactions, disputes, counterparty diversity \\
Attestations & issuer quality, claim freshness, negative warnings, organizational membership \\
Behavioral drift & sudden target change, outbound spike, language/style shift if permitted \\
Adversarial proximity & similarity to known scam/Sybil/bot clusters \\
Local context & prior relationship with verifier, personal allowlist, private history \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Trust Manifolds}

Let \(\mathcal{M}_T\) be the manifold of organic trusted behavior and \(\mathcal{M}_A\) be the manifold of adversarial behavior.

\begin{align}
    D_T(i,t) &= \dist(x_i(t), \mathcal{M}_T), \\
    D_A(i,t) &= \dist(x_i(t), \mathcal{M}_A), \\
    \drift_i(t) &= \left\|x_i(t) - x_i(t-\Delta t)\right\|.
\end{align}

A reference score can be written:

\begin{equation}
S_i(t) = 100 \cdot \sigmoid\left(
    -\alpha D_T(i,t)
    + \beta D_A(i,t)
    - \gamma \drift_i(t)
    + \delta \attest_i(t)
    + \eta R_i(t)
\right).
\end{equation}

This score must be explainable, probabilistic, and provider-specific. \TSL{} should never claim mathematical omniscience.

\begin{warningbox}{Research Math vs. Canonical Implementation}
The manifold, sigmoid, entropy, covariance, Mahalanobis-distance, and AUROC/ECE formulas in this section are research and evaluation notation. They describe model intent and audit criteria, not signed wire-format arithmetic. A reference implementation MUST emit signed protocol objects using deterministic fixed-point integers, usually basis points or milli-units, and MUST define exact rounding in the algorithm registry and test vectors. Real-valued equations MAY guide model development, but they are not canonical serialization rules.
\end{warningbox}

\subsection{Reference MVP Score}

Before advanced graph neural networks, use transparent scoring:

\begin{align}
\operatorname{score} ={}&
    0.20 \cdot \operatorname{crypto\_validity} \\
& + 0.15 \cdot \operatorname{identity\_age} \\
& + 0.15 \cdot \operatorname{reciprocity} \\
& + 0.15 \cdot \operatorname{trusted\_neighbor\_ratio} \\
& + 0.10 \cdot \operatorname{receipt\_quality} \\
& + 0.10 \cdot \operatorname{attestation\_quality} \\
& + 0.10 \cdot \operatorname{temporal\_consistency} \\
& + 0.05 \cdot \operatorname{local\_relationship}.
\end{align}

Map scores to cautious labels:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{ll}
\toprule
Score & Label \\
\midrule
90--100 & Trusted \\
75--89 & Likely trusted \\
55--74 & Medium trust \\
35--54 & Unknown / caution \\
15--34 & Suspicious \\
0--14 & High risk \\
Special & Revoked / compromised / insufficient evidence \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

% ============================================================
\section{Trust Assessment as a Signed Object}
% ============================================================

A trust score should not be a universal truth. It should be a signed assessment from a model, provider, or local verifier.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.trust_assessment.v1",
  "subject": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",
  "issuer": "did:tsl:scoring-provider:continuity-labs",
  "score": 82,
  "label": "likely_trusted",
  "model_version": "graph-risk-v0.3.1",
  "evidence_commitment": "0x...",
  "features_disclosed": [
    "valid_signature",
    "reciprocal_receipt_history",
    "low_scam_cluster_similarity"
  ],
  "explanation": [
    "Signature is valid under current key registry",
    "Identity has 31 months of continuity",
    "Counterparty receipts are diverse and reciprocal",
    "No active revocation or compromise warning"
  ],
  "issued_at": "2026-05-25T00:05:00Z",
  "expires_at": "2026-06-25T00:05:00Z",
  "signature": "provider_signature"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{principlebox}{Plural Scoring}
The protocol should allow multiple scoring providers, local models, domain-specific models, and user-selected risk policies. The base protocol settles evidence; it should not become one centralized reputation oracle.
\end{principlebox}


% ============================================================
\section{Trust-Scoring Science: Hyper-Specific Normative Implementation}
% ============================================================

The base protocol proves signed facts. The scoring layer estimates contextual risk from those facts. A compliant implementation MUST preserve the following invariant:

\begin{equation}
\text{Protocol validity} \neq \text{trustworthiness} \neq \text{humanity} \neq \text{lawfulness}.
\end{equation}

A \TSL{} verifier MUST first compute cryptographic validity. A trust model MAY then compute a signed assessment. A failed cryptographic gate MUST NOT be repaired by a high score.

\begin{principlebox}{Robust Variant}
The most robust implementation is not one global reputation score. It is a set of domain-specific, signed, calibrated, expiring assessments over versioned evidence profiles. The protocol settles evidence; scoring providers compete on accuracy, calibration, privacy, auditability, and appeal quality.
\end{principlebox}

\subsection{Three Implementation Variants}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.20\textwidth} p{0.24\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Variant & Use & Required Properties \\
\midrule
MVP transparent scorer & Early demos, proof links, private beta & Hand-weighted features, no raw private data, signed scores, expiration, local override, explicit insufficient-evidence labels. \\
Production calibrated scorer & Enterprise APIs, marketplaces, agent workflows & Versioned feature registry, domain thresholds, time-split evaluation, calibration report, confidence interval, appeal path, provider registry entry. \\
High-assurance scorer & Banking, large payments, supply chain, regulated workflows & Independent audit, red-team pass, shadow deployment before promotion, privacy leakage report, reproducible evaluation package, emergency rollback, human review for severe negative labels. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Hard Gates Before Any Score}

The verifier computes a gate vector:

\begin{equation}
g_i=(schema,canon,sig,key,revocation,inclusion,checkpoint,settlement,delegation).
\end{equation}

The default hard gate is:

\begin{equation}
G_i=schema\land canon\land sig\land key\land \neg revocation\land inclusion\land checkpoint.
\end{equation}

If the verifier policy requires chain finality, then:

\begin{equation}
G_i^{settled}=G_i\land settlement.
\end{equation}

A scoring provider MUST return one of the following before numeric scoring:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.28\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Gate Outcome & Required Behavior \\
\midrule
Valid core proof & Numeric trust assessment MAY be computed. \\
Invalid signature & Return \texttt{cryptographic\_failure}; no ordinary score. \\
Revoked key & Return \texttt{revoked\_or\_compromised}; no ordinary score. \\
Missing inclusion proof & Return \texttt{unsettled\_or\_unproven}; risk score MAY be suppressed. \\
Settlement required but absent & Return \texttt{settlement\_missing}; verifier policy decides accept or reject. \\
Delegation absent for agent action & Return \texttt{delegation\_missing}; no action authorization. \\
Sparse evidence but no adverse signal & Return \texttt{insufficient\_evidence}, not \texttt{suspicious}. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Domain Policies}

Every score MUST be bound to a domain policy. The same evidence can imply different action in different domains.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.domain_policy.v1",
  "domain": "agent_payments",
  "policy_version": "agent-payments-2026-05-26",

  "false_positive_cost_class": "medium",
  "false_negative_cost_class": "critical",
  "sparse_identity_default": "unknown_caution",
  "accepted_provider_status": ["active", "probation_allowed"],
  "human_review_required_labels": ["public_high_risk", "fraud_claim"]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} p{0.18\textwidth} p{0.22\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Domain & Primary Failure & Threshold Bias & Default Action \\
\midrule
Anti-phishing & False negative & Warn early; tolerate more caution labels & Block or warn on hard proof failures and strong adversarial proximity. \\
Marketplace trust & Both sides & Balance buyer safety and seller false positives & Use evidence coverage, dispute rates, and appealable warnings. \\
Agent payments & False negative & Extremely conservative above value thresholds & Require delegation, settlement, and step-up approval. \\
Open-source supply chain & False positive & Protect legitimate maintainer changes & Use drift as step-up trigger, not automatic accusation. \\
Professional identity & False positive & Avoid defamation and caste effects & Prefer continuity proofs and private verifier context. \\
Customer support & False negative & Verify organization authority first & Require org membership and current delegation. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scoring Profile Object}

A scoring profile is the executable contract between provider, verifier, auditor, and user.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.scoring_profile.v2",
  "profile_id": "did:tsl:provider:continuity-labs/profile/anti-phishing-v2.1.0",

  "expires_at": "2026-08-26T00:00:00Z",
  "signature": "provider_signature"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Feature Definition Schema}

Every feature MUST be named, typed, normalized, privacy-classified, and attack-modeled.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.feature_definition.v2",
  "feature_id": "graph.reciprocity_bps.v1",
  "name": "reciprocity_bps",

  "required_evidence": ["verified_receipts"],
  "forbidden_inputs": ["raw_message", "exact_private_counterparty_without_consent"],
  "normalizer_id": "bounded_ratio_identity_v1",
  "default_weight_bps": 1200,
  "missing_value_policy": "impute_zero_with_coverage_penalty",
  "stability_window_days": 90,
  "privacy_class": "aggregate",
  "audit_level": "recomputable_from_disclosed_or_provider_visible_evidence",
  "known_attacks": ["receipt_farming", "collusive_counterparties", "replay_attempts"],
  "mitigations": ["counterparty_diversity", "seed_escape", "temporal_decay"]
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Exact Reference Feature Set}

Let \(i\) be the subject, \(t\) be the assessment time, \(e\) be a verified event, \(c_e\) be its class, \(\tau_e\) be its timestamp, and \(\omega_e(t)\) be its effective graph weight. Let \(\varepsilon=10^{-9}\).

\begin{longtable}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} p{0.26\textwidth} p{0.40\textwidth}}
\toprule
Feature & Formula & Implementation Rule \\
\midrule
Cryptographic gate & \(f_{crypto}=\mathbb{I}[G_i=1]\) & Hard gate. If zero, suppress ordinary score. \\
Identity age & \(1-e^{-\min(a_i,730)/180}\) & \(a_i\) is age in days since registry creation or verified local creation. \\
Active key age & \(1-e^{-\min(k_i,365)/90}\) & Recent key age is downweighted unless rotation has valid recovery proof. \\
Signed event count & \(\frac{\log(1+n_i)}{\log(1+1000)}\) clipped & Counts only valid, non-replayed, included events. \\
Receipt count & \(\frac{\log(1+r_i)}{\log(1+300)}\) clipped & Counts only co-signed receipts whose counterparties are distinct after clustering. \\
Reciprocity & \(\frac{\sum_j \min(w_{ij},w_{ji})}{\sum_j \max(w_{ij},w_{ji})+\varepsilon}\) & One-way broadcasts do not become strong continuity. \\
Counterparty diversity & \(1-\sum_j p_{ij}^2\) & Uses trust-weighted edge mass; penalizes closed farms. \\
Community escape & \(\frac{\sum_{j:comm(j)\neq comm(i)}w_{ij}}{\sum_jw_{ij}+\varepsilon}\) & Low escape is a Sybil warning when paired with density and synchronization. \\
Trusted neighbor mass & \(\frac{\sum_j w_{ij}S_jq_j}{\sum_j w_{ij}+\varepsilon}\) & Neighbor score \(S_j\) and coverage \(q_j\) MUST be model-versioned. \\
Dispute rate & \(\frac{d_i}{r_i+d_i+\varepsilon}\) & Disputes require evidence commitments and appeal state. \\
Attestation quality & \(\operatorname{clip}_{0,1}\sum_a Q_a\kappa_a d_a\) & Expired and reversed attestations contribute zero or negative weight. \\
Revocation risk & \(\mathbb{I}[recent\ compromise]\) & Triggers warning window after compromise event. \\
Cadence stability & \(1-\operatorname{clip}_{0,1}(MADZ_i/8)\) & Robust z-score over activity intervals. \\
Dormant reactivation & \(\mathbb{I}[inactive>90d \land burst>p95]\) & Step-up trigger, not automatic fraud. \\
Adversarial proximity & \(e^{-D_A^2/\sigma_A^2}\) & Risk penalty; must disclose cluster source class. \\
Local relationship & private verifier value & MUST remain local unless user discloses. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

All clipped features are clipped to \([0,1]\). Output features stored in protocol objects SHOULD be represented as integer basis points from \(0\) to \(10000\).

\subsection{Normalization Profiles}

For bounded ratios:

\begin{equation}
N_k(z)=\operatorname{clip}_{0,1}(z).
\end{equation}

For counts:

\begin{equation}
N_k(z)=\operatorname{clip}_{0,1}\left(\frac{\log(1+z)-\log(1+p_{1,k})}{\log(1+p_{99,k})-\log(1+p_{1,k})+\varepsilon}\right).
\end{equation}

For heavy-tailed positive values:

\begin{equation}
N_k(z)=\operatorname{clip}_{0,1}\left(\frac{\operatorname{asinh}(z/s_k)}{\operatorname{asinh}(p_{99,k}/s_k)}\right).
\end{equation}

For risk penalties where higher means worse:

\begin{equation}
Safe_k(z)=1-N_k(z).
\end{equation}

The normalization profile MUST include the training window, percentiles, missing-value policy, and whether parameters were fitted on a time-split training set.

\subsection{Reference Weight Profile}

The robust default separates gates, positive evidence, penalties, and uncertainty. This is an implementation profile, not a universal truth.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.26\textwidth} p{0.15\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Component & Weight & Rule \\
\midrule
Cryptographic validity & Gate & Required before ordinary scoring. \\
Identity and key continuity & 1400 basis points & Age helps, but cannot dominate because old identities can be compromised. \\
Receipts and reciprocity & 2200 basis points & Co-signed diverse receipts are the core scarce signal. \\
Counterparty and community diversity & 1400 basis points & Prevents farms from converting volume into trust. \\
Attestation quality & 1000 basis points & Useful but issuer-abuse bounded. \\
Temporal consistency & 900 basis points & Detects compromise and laundering. \\
Trusted-neighbor mass & 900 basis points & Useful with coverage weighting and seed governance. \\
Domain-specific feature & 700 basis points & Example: dispute rate for marketplace, delegation scope for agents. \\
Local relationship & 500 basis points & Private verifier context; never globalized by default. \\
Adversarial proximity penalty & up to 2500 basis points & Strong in anti-phishing, weaker in high-false-positive domains. \\
Drift penalty & up to 1500 basis points & Usually produces step-up, not permanent label. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

The raw score is:

\begin{equation}
z_i=b+\sum_{k\in K^+}w_kN_k(f_{ik})-\sum_{\ell\in K^-}u_{\ell}N_{\ell}(r_{i\ell})-u_q(1-q_i).
\end{equation}

The calibrated score is:

\begin{equation}
S_i=\operatorname{round}(10000\cdot C(z_i)),
\end{equation}

where \(C\) MUST be a declared monotone calibration function.

\subsection{Evidence Coverage and Abstention}

Evidence coverage measures whether the provider has enough verified evidence to make a confident claim.

\begin{equation}
q_i=G_i\cdot \min\left(1,\frac{n_{events}}{25}\right)^{0.25}\cdot
\min\left(1,\frac{n_{receipts}}{10}\right)^{0.35}\cdot
\min\left(1,\frac{n_{counterparties}}{5}\right)^{0.40}.
\end{equation}

A provider MUST abstain or use caution labels when coverage is low:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} p{0.18\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Coverage & Label Policy & Meaning \\
\midrule
\(q_i<0.25\) & Insufficient evidence & Do not infer suspiciousness from newness. \\
\(0.25\leq q_i<0.50\) & Unknown or caution & Score MAY be shown with wide interval. \\
\(0.50\leq q_i<0.75\) & Medium confidence & Ordinary labels allowed except highest trust. \\
\(q_i\geq0.75\) & High confidence & Full label range allowed if calibration supports it. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.evidence_coverage.v1",
  "subject": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",

  "recent_revocation_count": 0,
  "coverage_bps": 8600,
  "coverage_label": "high",
  "missing_evidence": []
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Calibration and Confidence Intervals}

Providers MUST report calibration on held-out time-split data. Expected calibration error is:

\begin{equation}
ECE=\sum_{b=1}^{B}\frac{|B_b|}{n}\left|acc(B_b)-conf(B_b)\right|.
\end{equation}

A score assessment SHOULD include a confidence interval. For transparent models, bootstrap over edges, counterparties, and attestations:

\begin{equation}
CI_{95}(S_i)=\left[Q_{0.025}(S_i^*),Q_{0.975}(S_i^*)\right].
\end{equation}

For sparse identities, the interval MUST widen by a coverage penalty:

\begin{equation}
width_{adj}=width_{boot}+\lambda_q(1-q_i).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Thresholds and False-Positive / False-Negative Tradeoff}

A label threshold MUST be derived from a domain cost model:

\begin{equation}
L(\theta)=c_{FP}FPR(\theta)+c_{FN}FNR(\theta)+c_AA(Abstain(\theta))+c_{Appeal}AppealRate(\theta).
\end{equation}

The reference labels are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.18\textwidth} p{0.30\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Label & Required Rule & Notes \\
\midrule
Trusted & \(S\geq9000\), lower CI \(\geq8000\), \(q\geq0.75\) & Never shown for sparse identities. \\
Likely trusted & \(7500\leq S<9000\), \(q\geq0.50\) & Good continuity, not a guarantee. \\
Medium trust & \(5500\leq S<7500\) & Mixed or moderate evidence. \\
Unknown caution & \(3500\leq S<5500\) or low coverage & Default for legitimate new users. \\
Suspicious & \(1500\leq S<3500\) and adverse evidence present & Requires adverse signal beyond newness. \\
High risk & \(S<1500\) or hard negative proof & Reserved for revoked, compromised, scam-like, or severe abuse evidence. \\
Cryptographic failure & Any failed hard gate & Separate from score. \\

\section{Metadata Fingerprint Model: Privacy-Preserving Implementation}
% ============================================================

Metadata fingerprints are local, scope-limited summaries of continuity-relevant metadata. They are not public tracking identifiers. They MUST NOT become a cross-platform surveillance layer.

\subsection{Implementation Variants}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.20\textwidth} p{0.25\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Variant & Storage & Disclosure \\
\midrule
Local-only & Encrypted client store & Used only for local drift and relationship scoring. \\
Pairwise verifier & Derived per verifier domain & Stable only between subject and verifier; not reusable globally. \\
Provider aggregate & Provider receives buckets or proofs & Provider computes features without raw content or exact graph by default. \\
Public commitment & Salted commitment only & Proves existence or timestamp without opening metadata. \\
High-assurance private proof & Commitments plus ZK predicates & Proves threshold facts without disclosing raw metadata. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Allowed, Restricted, and Forbidden Metadata}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} p{0.16\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Input & Default Rule & Notes \\
\midrule
Event class & Allowed & Message, receipt, transaction, agent call, code release. \\
Coarse timestamp bucket & Allowed & Exact timestamp MAY remain local; public log epoch already leaks coarse timing. \\
Content length bucket & Restricted & Use coarse buckets only; exact size can leak content. \\
Counterparty commitment & Allowed with salt & Exact counterparty stays local unless disclosed. \\
Key lineage & Allowed & Key age and rotation history are protocol facts. \\
Response latency bucket & Restricted & Useful for continuity; risky if exact. \\
Platform or transport & Local by default & Public platform tags can enable correlation. \\
Language or style embedding & Opt-in only & Content-derived; should be local or explicitly disclosed. \\
IP address, precise location, device fingerprint & Forbidden by default & High privacy risk and weak continuity value. \\
Protected attributes & Forbidden & Race, religion, health, sexuality, political affiliation unless legally required and explicitly scoped. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Scope-Key Derivation and Rotation}

A fingerprint key MUST be scoped. The same metadata tuple MUST NOT produce a reusable global identifier across verifiers.

\begin{equation}
k_{scope}=KDF(k_{master},\texttt{``tsl-fp-v1''}\parallel context\parallel verifier\_domain\parallel epoch\parallel purpose).
\end{equation}

Reference purposes are:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.23\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Purpose & Rule \\
\midrule
Local only & Never disclosed; rotated every 90 days unless user pins a baseline. \\
Pairwise verifier & Unique per verifier domain; rotated every 180 days or on user request. \\
Provider ephemeral & Unique per scoring request or short epoch; prevents provider-side long-term linking. \\
Public commitment & No key disclosure; fresh salt per commitment. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Bucketization}

Metadata MUST be minimized before fingerprinting. A reference tuple is:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
\mu_t=(&event\_class, time\_bucket, length\_bucket,\\
&key\_lineage\_bucket, counterparty\_class, receipt\_class).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Reference buckets:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.25\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Field & Reference Buckets \\
\midrule
Time & 5 minute, 1 hour, 1 day, or local-only exact time depending on policy. \\
Content length & 0--256 bytes, 257--1024, 1025--4096, 4097--16384, above 16384. \\
Response latency & below 1 minute, 1--10 minutes, 10--60 minutes, 1--24 hours, above 24 hours. \\
Counterparty class & local-known, public-org, verified-agent, unknown, private-undisclosed. \\
Key lineage & same-key, rotated-with-recovery, new-key-unverified, revoked. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Fingerprint and Commitment Construction}

\begin{align}
F_t &= HMAC_{k_{scope}}(\texttt{tsl.metadata.fp.v1}\parallel canon(\mu_t)),\\
C_{F,t} &= \hash(\texttt{tsl.metadata.commit.v1}\parallel F_t\parallel s_t),\\
R_F &= \MerkleRoot(C_{F,1},\ldots,C_{F,n}).
\end{align}

The salt \(s_t\) MUST be a fresh 256-bit random value. A public fingerprint commitment MUST NOT include \(F_t\) itself.

\subsection{Fingerprint Object}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.metadata_fingerprint_commitment.v1",
  "subject": "did:tsl:eip155-8453:0xabc...",
  "scope_class": "pairwise_verifier",
  "scope_commitment": "0xhash_of_verifier_domain_and_epoch",
  "bucket_profile": "tsl.bucket_profile.default.v1",
  "fingerprint_commitment": "0x...",
  "salt_commitment": "0x...",
  "created_at_bucket": "2026-05-26T00:00:00Z/PT1H",
  "expires_at": "2026-08-26T00:00:00Z",
  "disclosure_policy": "selective_or_zk",
  "signature": "subject_signature"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Stability and Spoofing}

Metadata features are classified by spoofing cost:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} p{0.18\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Class & Default Weight & Examples \\
\midrule
Cryptographic stable & High & Key lineage, revocation status, signed event chain. \\
Receipt-backed stable & High & Co-signed receipts, completed transactions. \\
Attestation-backed & Medium & Organization membership, issuer claims. \\
Cadence-derived & Low to medium & Timing, response latency, burstiness. \\
Self-reported & Low & User-declared platform, role, or metadata tags. \\
Content-derived opt-in & Domain-specific & Style or language embeddings; never default global feature. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

An adversary can shape cadence and length buckets. Therefore metadata-only evidence MUST NOT be enough for a high-trust label.

\subsection{Correlation Risk Budget}

A provider or client SHOULD estimate public correlation risk:

\begin{equation}
LeakageRisk=\alpha T_{precision}+\beta V_{volume}+\gamma C_{counterparty}+\delta P_{platform}+\eta U_{uniqueness}.
\end{equation}

Reference policy:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Risk & Required Mitigation \\
\midrule
Low & Ordinary salted commitments allowed. \\
Medium & Batch commitments, coarsen time, suppress platform tags. \\
High & Local-only or ZK threshold proof. \\
Severe & Do not publish; require pairwise verifier proof only. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

% ============================================================
\section{Graph Geometry: Construction Rules, Profiles, and Manifolds}
% ============================================================

At time \(t\), the trust graph is a typed, temporal, weighted multigraph:

\begin{equation}
G_t=(V_t,E_t,\mathcal{C},\omega,\tau,\Pi),
\end{equation}

where \(\Pi\) is the graph profile that defines edge types, weights, decay, community detection, seed rules, and privacy constraints.

\subsection{Graph Implementation Variants}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.20\textwidth} p{0.25\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Variant & Graph Data & Use \\
\midrule
Local verifier graph & User device or enterprise gateway & Personal relationship and private allowlist scoring. \\
Provider aggregate graph & Provider-visible commitments and disclosed proofs & General risk intelligence without raw private content. \\
Federated graph features & Multiple providers compute aggregates & Reduces centralized graph ownership. \\
Private graph proof & Commitments plus ZK or secure aggregation & High-assurance privacy for thresholds and distances. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Graph Profile Object}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.graph_profile.v2",
  "profile_id": "graph-default-2026-05",
  "edge_weight_profile": "default_edge_weights_v2",

  },
  "privacy_policy": {
    "raw_counterparty_upload_required": false,
    "allows_pairwise_private_features": true
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Allowed Graph Edges}

Edges MUST come from verifiable protocol objects or explicit local context. Scraped social links, follows, likes, profile similarity, and unverified contact lists MUST NOT be used as protocol graph edges.

\begin{longtable}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} p{0.14\textwidth} p{0.14\textwidth} p{0.36\textwidth}}
\toprule
Edge Type & Base Weight & Half-Life & Validation Rule \\
\midrule
Unilateral signed event & 0.10 & 90 days & Valid signature, active key, non-replayed nonce. \\
Received receipt & 0.30 & 180 days & Receiver co-signature over event commitment. \\
Reply receipt & 0.50 & 180 days & Reciprocal receipt or linked reply commitment. \\
Completed transaction & 1.00 & 365 days & Completion proof and no unresolved dispute. \\
Disputed transaction & -0.50 & 30 days & Evidence commitment and appeal path required. \\
Positive attestation & \(Q_j\kappa\) & Claim-specific & Valid issuer, non-expired claim, issuer quality. \\
Negative attestation & \(-Q_j\kappa\) & 7--90 days & Evidence, appeal, severity limit, reversal tracking. \\
Delegation edge & Scope-specific & Until expiry & Principal signature and active delegation. \\
Organization membership & 0.70 & Until expiry & Issuer status active; membership proof valid. \\
Code release signature & 0.60 & 365 days & Maintainer or release-bot key active. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

The effective edge weight is:

\begin{equation}
\omega_e(t)=\omega_{base}(c_e)\cdot q_{source(e)}\cdot d_{c_e}(t-\tau_e)\cdot \rho_e\cdot \chi_e,
\end{equation}

where \(q_{source}\) is counterparty or issuer quality, \(d_c\) is decay, \(\rho_e\) is receipt status, and \(\chi_e\) is an appeal/reversal multiplier.

\subsection{Temporal Decay}

Use exponential half-life decay:

\begin{equation}
d_c(\Delta)=2^{-\Delta/h_c}.
\end{equation}

Immediate state facts override decay. Revocation is not a decayed feature; it is a state transition.

\subsection{Reciprocity, Diversity, and Concentration}

Directional mass:

\begin{equation}
w_{ij}(t)=\sum_{e:i\rightarrow j}\omega_e(t).
\end{equation}

Pair reciprocity:

\begin{equation}
r_{ij}=\frac{2\min(w_{ij},w_{ji})}{w_{ij}+w_{ji}+\varepsilon}.
\end{equation}

Counterparty mass distribution:

\begin{equation}
p_{ij}=\frac{w_{ij}+w_{ji}}{\sum_k(w_{ik}+w_{ki})+\varepsilon}.
\end{equation}

Diversity metrics:

\begin{align}
HHI_i &= \sum_jp_{ij}^2,\\
D_i &= 1-HHI_i,\\
H_i &= -\sum_jp_{ij}\log(p_{ij}+\varepsilon),\\
N^{eff}_i &= e^{H_i}.
\end{align}

A high volume of edges with low \(N^{eff}\) is weak evidence.

\subsection{Community and Escape Metrics}

For community assignment \(comm(v)\):

\begin{align}
InternalMass_i &= \sum_{j:comm(j)=comm(i)}(w_{ij}+w_{ji}),\\
ExternalMass_i &= \sum_{j:comm(j)\neq comm(i)}(w_{ij}+w_{ji}),\\
Escape_i &= \frac{ExternalMass_i}{InternalMass_i+ExternalMass_i+\varepsilon}.
\end{align}

For a cluster \(C\):

\begin{align}
Density(C)&=\frac{\sum_{i,j\in C}w_{ij}}{|C|(|C|-1)+\varepsilon},\\
Conductance(C)&=\frac{cut(C,\bar C)}{\min(vol(C),vol(\bar C))+\varepsilon},\\
SeedEscape(C)&=\frac{\sum_{i\in C,j\in S_T}w_{ij}}{\sum_{i\in C,j}w_{ij}+\varepsilon}.
\end{align}

Low conductance, high internal density, low seed escape, and synchronized creation are Sybil evidence when observed together.

\subsection{Trusted and Adversarial Manifolds}

The organic manifold \(\mathcal{M}_T\) is a distribution over trajectories with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item long-lived key lineage or verified recovery,
    \item diverse reciprocal receipts,
    \item cross-community escape,
    \item low unresolved dispute rate,
    \item stable cadence with explainable changes,
    \item attestations from issuers with low reversal rates.
\end{itemize}

The adversarial manifold \(\mathcal{M}_A\) is a distribution over trajectories with:

\begin{itemize}
    \item synchronized identity creation,
    \item dense internal receipts and low external escape,
    \item shared issuer or device patterns where disclosure permits,
    \item abrupt target-community shifts,
    \item high outbound burstiness,
    \item proximity to evidence-bound abuse clusters.
\end{itemize}

Distance features MAY include:

\begin{align}
D_T(i)&=(x_i-\mu_T)^\top\Sigma_T^{-1}(x_i-\mu_T),\\
D_A(i)&=\min_{a\in\mathcal{A}}\operatorname{dist}(x_i,x_a),\\
D_{diff}(i,S)&=1-PPR_S(i),\\
D_{cluster}(i)&=\min_{C\in\mathcal{C}_A}\operatorname{dist}(x_i,\mu_C).
\end{align}

These are statistical features, not proof of fraud.

\begin{principlebox}{Fixed-Point Graph Outputs}
Graph math MAY be estimated with real-valued methods during research. Any graph feature written into a signed or hashed \TSL{} object MUST be converted to integer fields such as \texttt{reciprocity\_bps}, \texttt{counterparty\_hhi\_bps}, or \texttt{effective\_counterparty\_count\_milli}. Floating-point values MUST NOT appear in signed graph-profile, graph-feature, Sybil, drift, model-card, or evaluation-report objects.
\end{principlebox}

% ============================================================
\section{Sybil Detection and New Identity Handling}
% ============================================================

Sybil detection in \TSL{} is not a binary claim that an identity is fake. It is a cost-aware estimate that a set of identities is controlled, coordinated, or inflated in a way that should reduce trust or require step-up verification.

\subsection{Threat Budget Tiers}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.13\textwidth} p{0.28\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Tier & Capability & Examples \\
\midrule
B0 & Cheap fake identities & Scripted accounts, no durable receipts. \\
B1 & Internal receipt farm & Controlled identities co-sign each other. \\
B2 & Purchased aged identities & Old accounts or keys acquired from others. \\
B3 & Compromised real identities & Stolen keys, session hijack, device compromise. \\
B4 & Corrupt or weak issuer & False attestations from issuer-like accounts. \\
B5 & Relay, provider, or auditor collusion & Checkpoint manipulation, model abuse, selective visibility. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Sybil Resistance Assumptions}

The protocol assumes:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item uncompromised signatures cannot be forged,
    \item diverse reciprocal receipts from honest regions are costly to obtain,
    \item audited issuers face penalties for false attestations,
    \item append-only checkpoints prevent undetectable history rewriting,
    \item at least one honest auditor or verifier observes conflicting public checkpoint views,
    \item scoring providers are plural and challengeable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Cluster Metrics}

For a candidate cluster \(C\):

\begin{align}
CreationSync(C)&=1-\frac{MAD(created\_at(C))}{T_{sync}+\varepsilon},\\
InternalRatio(C)&=\frac{\sum_{i,j\in C}w_{ij}}{\sum_{i\in C,j}w_{ij}+\varepsilon},\\
ExternalDiversity(C)&=1-\sum_{q}P_{Cq}^{2},\\
IssuerReuse(C)&=\max_m\frac{|\{i\in C:issuer(i)=m\}|}{|C|},\\
ReceiptSymmetry(C)&=\frac{\sum_{i,j\in C}\min(w_{ij},w_{ji})}{\sum_{i,j\in C}\max(w_{ij},w_{ji})+\varepsilon},\\
SeedEscape(C)&=\frac{\sum_{i\in C,j\in S_T}w_{ij}}{\sum_{i\in C,j}w_{ij}+\varepsilon}.
\end{align}

Reference Sybil cluster risk:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
Risk(C)=\sigma(&\alpha_0+\alpha_1InternalRatio+\alpha_2CreationSync+\alpha_3IssuerReuse\\
&+\alpha_4ReceiptSymmetry-\alpha_5SeedEscape-\alpha_6ExternalDiversity).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Cost-of-Attack Model}

An attacker seeking score \(S^*\) must buy or create evidence:

\begin{equation}
Cost(S^*)=C_{ids}+C_{time}+C_{external\_receipts}+C_{attestations}+C_{compromise}+C_{evasion}.
\end{equation}

The robust design objective is:

\begin{equation}
Cost(S^*) > ExpectedBenefit(S^*)
\end{equation}

for high-risk actions in target domains.

\subsection{Collusion Simulation Profile}

Every production scorer SHOULD test at least these synthetic attacks:

\section{Behavioral Drift and Compromise Detection}
% ============================================================

Behavioral drift is a change in trajectory. It is not automatically bad. The robust implementation treats drift as a step-up signal unless it is combined with hard evidence of compromise or adversarial activity.

\subsection{Drift Windows}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.20\textwidth} p{0.18\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Window & Reference Duration & Purpose \\
\midrule
Immediate & 1 hour & Burst, spam, unusual agent tool use. \\
Short & 24 hours & Compromise indicators and sudden target change. \\
Medium & 30 days & New community, new transaction pattern, new cadence. \\
Long & 180 days & Baseline continuity and seasonal behavior. \\
Dormant & 90 or more inactive days & Reactivation risk; requires special handling. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Drift Vector}

The drift vector is grouped so explanations are actionable:

\begin{equation}
\Delta_i=(\Delta_{key},\Delta_{graph},\Delta_{action},\Delta_{cadence},\Delta_{claim},\Delta_{agent},\Delta_{local}).
\end{equation}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Component & Examples \\
\midrule
Key drift & New active key, recovery event, device-key churn, post-revocation behavior. \\
Graph drift & New counterparties, old counterparties absent, new community, seed distance change. \\
Action drift & New transaction type, new code release behavior, new outbound message class. \\
Cadence drift & Burstiness, dormant reactivation, unusual time bucket, response latency shift. \\
Claim drift & New negative attestation, expired org membership, conflicting attestations. \\
Agent drift & New tools, parameter ranges, subdelegation attempts, value escalation. \\
Local drift & Verifier-specific relationship break, local denylist, unusual direct context. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Baseline Model}

For feature vector \(x_i(t)\), compute a robust baseline from a long window:

\begin{align}
\mu_i^{base} &= median(x_i(t-W_L),\ldots,x_i(t-W_M)),\\
\Sigma_i^{base} &= robustCov(x_i),\\
D_i^{Maha} &= \sqrt{(x_i^{cur}-\mu_i^{base})^\top(\Sigma_i^{base}+\lambda I)^{-1}(x_i^{cur}-\mu_i^{base})}.
\end{align}

For sparse identities, use cohort baselines and widen uncertainty.

\subsection{Drift Score}

\begin{equation}
DriftRisk_i=\operatorname{clip}_{0,1}\left(\frac{D_i^{Maha}}{D_{crit}}\right)\cdot q_i + DormantPenalty_i + KeyPenalty_i.
\end{equation}

Reference thresholds:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.20\textwidth} p{0.16\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Risk & Threshold & Action \\
\midrule
Low & below 2500 basis points & No special action. \\
Moderate & 2500--5000 & Show explanation; reduce confidence. \\
High & 5000--7500 & Step-up verification for high-value actions. \\
Severe & above 7500 & Block or quarantine in high-risk domains until recovery or review. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\midrule
Key change & No recovery proof, followed by burst & Signed rotation with recovery policy. \\
Dormant reactivation & Immediate outbound requests or payments & Step-up proof and gradual return. \\
Graph shift & Old counterparties vanish, new targets appear & New org membership or disclosed role change. \\
Agent tool change & New high-risk tool or value escalation & New delegation signed by principal. \\
Attestations & Negative claims unresolved & Positive verified migration attestation. \\

% ============================================================
\section{Attestation Trust Model}
% ============================================================

An attestation proves that an issuer made a claim. It does not prove the claim is true. A robust \TSL{} implementation treats attestations as evidence with issuer quality, claim class, decay, conflict handling, and appeal mechanics.

\subsection{Issuer Quality}

Issuer quality is domain-specific:

\begin{equation}
\begin{aligned}
Q_j^d=\sigma(&\beta_0+\beta_1Audit_j+\beta_2Accuracy_j+\beta_3Age_j+\beta_4StakeOrBond_j\\
&-\beta_5Reversal_j-\beta_6Dispute_j-\beta_7Conflict_j).
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}

Where no token or bond exists, \(StakeOrBond\) is replaced by contractual accountability, public audit status, or enterprise trust tier. Token ownership alone MUST NOT increase issuer quality.

\subsection{Attestation Classes and Controls}

\begin{longtable}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} p{0.24\textwidth} p{0.38\textwidth}}
\toprule
Class & Evidence Requirement & Abuse Control \\
\midrule
Organization member & Membership record commitment & Expiration, issuer revocation, subject consent where needed. \\
Known business & Business registry or domain proof & Periodic renewal and issuer audit. \\
Verified maintainer & Repository or release-key proof & Code-release drift monitoring. \\
Trusted counterparty & Prior receipt or contract proof & Weight capped; no global trust inflation. \\
Private warning & Local evidence & Not public by default; expiration. \\
Provider risk flag & Evidence commitment and provider signature & Appeal URI, short expiry, audit sampling. \\
Public negative claim & Strong evidence commitment and high issuer quality & Appeal before high-impact propagation where feasible. \\
Compromise warning & Revocation or recovery evidence & Immediate visibility; short review loop. \\
Fraud label & Adjudicated evidence & Human review, reversal mechanics, defamation-aware policy. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Attestation Decay}

Positive attestations decay unless the claim type has explicit validity:

\begin{equation}
Value(a,t)=Q_{issuer(a)}\cdot \kappa_{class(a)}\cdot 2^{-(t-t_a)/h_a}\cdot StateMultiplier(a,t).
\end{equation}

Negative attestations decay faster unless renewed with evidence:

\begin{equation}
NegValue(a,t)=-Q_{issuer(a)}\cdot \kappa_{class(a)}\cdot 2^{-(t-t_a)/h_a}\cdot AppealMultiplier(a,t).
\end{equation}

If an attestation is reversed, its contribution becomes zero and the issuer reversal rate increases.

\subsection{Conflict Resolution}

For claim class \(c\):

\begin{align}
PosMass_c &= \sum_{a\in A^+_c}Value(a,t),\\
NegMass_c &= \sum_{a\in A^-_c}|NegValue(a,t)|,\\
Conflict_c &= \frac{\min(PosMass_c,NegMass_c)}{PosMass_c+NegMass_c+\varepsilon}.
\end{align}

High conflict does not automatically mean high risk. It means the verifier must show the conflict and possibly require review.

\subsection{Attestation Object V2}

  "submitted_at": "2026-05-26T00:00:00Z",
  "status": "submitted",
  "signature": "subject_signature"
}
\end{lstlisting}

A public negative claim MUST expose an appeal state: \texttt{submitted}, \texttt{under\_review}, \texttt{upheld}, \texttt{reversed}, \texttt{expired}, or \texttt{escalated}. In ordinary prose, these machine labels should be rendered without implying guilt before adjudication.

% ============================================================
\section{Privacy-Preserving Analytics and Zero-Knowledge Roadmap}
% ============================================================

The privacy roadmap MUST be staged. \TSL{} adoption should not depend on advanced private graph proofs in the MVP. The robust path is selective disclosure first, threshold proofs second, private graph analytics last.

\subsection{Privacy Implementation Variants}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.18\textwidth} p{0.27\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Stage & Primitive & Use \\
\midrule
P0 & Salted commitments & Commit content, metadata, counterparties without disclosure. \\
P1 & Merkle inclusion proofs & Prove event or receipt exists in a committed set. \\
P2 & Selective disclosure & Open one claim without opening the whole graph. \\
P3 & Threshold ZK & Prove age, count, rate, or value bounds. \\
P4 & Set membership and non-membership & Prove membership in org set or absence from revocation/abuse set. \\
P5 & Delegation-scope proof & Prove parameters satisfy policy without revealing all parameters. \\
P6 & Private graph analytics & Approximate distance or escape metrics using commitments or secure aggregation. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Required Circuit Interfaces}

\begin{longtable}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} p{0.28\textwidth} p{0.38\textwidth}}
\toprule
Circuit & Public Claim & Private Witness \\
\midrule
Age threshold & Identity age exceeds \(T\) & Creation proof, salt, registry path. \\
Receipt count threshold & Reciprocal receipts exceed \(N\) & Receipt leaves, salts, counterparties, paths. \\
Dispute-rate bound & Dispute rate below \(r\) & Completed and disputed receipt leaves. \\
Set membership & Subject is in approved set & Membership leaf, salt, Merkle path. \\
Non-membership & Subject absent from revocation or abuse set & Sparse Merkle non-membership path. \\
Organization membership & Subject has active org claim & Attestation witness and issuer path. \\
Delegation scope & Action parameters are within scope & Parameter values, policy witness, delegation path. \\
Private graph distance & Distance or escape exceeds threshold & Committed local neighborhood, aggregate proof, seed commitments. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Production ZK Ceremony and Release Decision}

For production and \texttt{TSL-MAINNET}, the required circuit interfaces above MUST be released through a new protocol-specific ceremony. Existing local setup artifacts, development fixtures, prototype circuits, and any circuit identifier marked \texttt{dev}, \texttt{fixture}, \texttt{prototype}, or equivalent MUST NOT satisfy production policy.

Each production circuit release MUST include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item circuit source hash;
    \item R1CS hash;
    \item WASM hash;
    \item zkey hash;
    \item verification-key hash;
    \item declared hash suite;
    \item public-signal schema;
    \item private-witness schema;
    \item soundness bits, with minimum \(100\);
    \item privacy notes describing the disclosed statement and hidden witness;
    \item ceremony transcript hash;
    \item manifest signature;
    \item reviewer or auditor signature.
\end{itemize}

The selected production hash suite for circuit-internal commitments is \texttt{poseidon-bn254-v1}. Off-circuit object commitments and release-manifest commitments remain canonical SHA-256 domain-separated commitments unless a later conformance level explicitly upgrades them.

The production release set is:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \texttt{identity\_age\_days}
    \item \texttt{reciprocal\_receipt\_count}
    \item \texttt{dispute\_rate\_bound}
    \item \texttt{set\_membership}
    \item \texttt{revocation\_set\_non\_membership}
    \item \texttt{organization\_membership}
    \item \texttt{agent\_scope\_compliance}
    \item \texttt{private\_graph\_distance}
\end{enumerate}

The production verification-key registry MUST reject:

\begin{itemize}
    \item any unregistered circuit;
    \item any inactive or revoked manifest;
    \item any proof whose verification key does not hash to the registered manifest key;
    \item any manifest without a signature;
    \item any manifest without public and private witness schemas;
    \item any manifest below the configured soundness threshold;
    \item any development or fixture circuit under production policy.
\end{itemize}

Mainnet readiness for ZK proofs is blocked until a real ceremony transcript, verification-key registry, external circuit review, and protocol security approval exist. Generated text, local fixtures, or repository-only placeholders MUST NOT count as ceremony or audit evidence.

\subsection{Example Threshold Proof Request}

  },
  "disclosure_policy": "do_not_reveal_counterparties",
  "verifier_domain": "marketplace.example"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Metadata Privacy Leakage Analysis}

A privacy report MUST consider:

\begin{itemize}
    \item timing leakage from checkpoint epochs,
    \item volume leakage from repeated commitments,
    \item uniqueness leakage from unusual bucket combinations,
    \item counterparty correlation through repeated pairwise proofs,
    \item public commitment reuse across domains,
    \item provider-side linkage through scoring requests,
    \item appeal and negative-claim disclosure risks.
\end{itemize}

Reference leakage score:

\begin{equation}
PLS=1-\prod_k(1-l_k),
\end{equation}

where \(l_k\) are normalized leakage components. High-assurance profiles MUST publish mitigation for any \(PLS>0.35\).

% ============================================================
\section{Model Governance and Provider Accountability}
% ============================================================

Scoring providers are not protocol truth authorities. They are accountable issuers of probabilistic assessments.

\subsection{Provider Lifecycle}

\begin{equation}
registered \rightarrow shadow \rightarrow active \rightarrow probation \rightarrow suspended \rightarrow revoked.
\end{equation}

Models follow:

\begin{equation}
draft \rightarrow offline\_evaluated \rightarrow shadow \rightarrow canary \rightarrow active \rightarrow deprecated \rightarrow retired.
\end{equation}

A provider on probation MAY issue assessments only if verifier policy accepts probationary providers.

ReversalRate &= \frac{reversed\_assessments}{challenged\_assessments+\varepsilon},\\
TimelyAppealRate &= \frac{appeals\_closed\_within\_SLA}{appeals\_submitted+\varepsilon}.
\end{align}

Sanctions MAY include downgrade to probation, model retirement, assessment-key revocation, public audit finding, bond slashing if a bond module exists, or removal from default verifier policy.

\subsection{Release Controls}

A model update MUST NOT become active unless:

\begin{equation}
EvalPass \land CalibrationPass \land PrivacyPass \land RedTeamPass \land RollbackPlanExists.
\end{equation}

Production models SHOULD be deployed through shadow and canary phases. Canary exposure SHOULD be below 10\% before promotion unless emergency mitigation is declared.

% ============================================================
\section{Evaluation Framework}
% ============================================================

The evaluation framework must test accuracy, calibration, fairness to sparse identities, latency, privacy leakage, robustness under attacks, and longitudinal drift.

\subsection{Benchmark Dataset Families}

\begin{longtable}{>{\bfseries}p{0.23\textwidth} p{0.28\textwidth} p{0.37\textwidth}}
\toprule
Dataset & Source & Purpose \\
\midrule
Historical benign continuity & Verified logs and partner opt-in data & Estimate ordinary trajectory distribution. \\
Confirmed abuse & Evidence-bound phishing, fraud, scam, compromised identity cases & Positive adversarial labels. \\
Appeal adjudication & Reversed and upheld assessments & Measure label quality and provider abuse. \\
Sparse legitimate identities & New users, privacy-preserving users, low-volume users & Prevent new-user punishment. \\
Synthetic Sybil farms & Simulated collusion graphs & Stress-test cluster metrics. \\
Compromise simulations & Key theft and dormant reactivation scripts & Test drift detection. \\
Agent misuse traces & Tool calls, delegation violations, value escalation & Test agent authorization. \\
Negative controls & Similar-looking but benign communities & Measure false positives. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Ground Truth Labeling}

Labels MUST be time-indexed:

\begin{equation}
y_i(t)\in\{benign,abusive,compromised,sybil,unknown,disputed\}.
\end{equation}

A label is valid only for a time window and evidence class. Human adjudication SHOULD use at least two independent reviewers for high-impact negative labels, with a tie-breaker for disagreement.

\subsection{Metrics}

\begin{align}
AUROC&=\Pr(S^+>S^-),\\
Precision&=\frac{TP}{TP+FP},\\
Recall&=\frac{TP}{TP+FN},\\
FPR_{sparse}&=\frac{FP_{sparse}}{FP_{sparse}+TN_{sparse}},\\
ECE&=\sum_b\frac{|B_b|}{n}|acc(B_b)-conf(B_b)|,\\
Coverage&=\frac{assessments\_not\_abstained}{total\_eligible},\\
Leakage&=PLS,\\
Latency_{p95}&=Q_{0.95}(verification\_time).
\end{align}

\subsection{Promotion Gates by Domain}

Promotion gates are expressed in fixed-point basis points for machine-readable reports. For example, \texttt{auroc\_bps = 9200} means AUROC 0.92.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.20\textwidth} p{0.18\textwidth} p{0.18\textwidth} X}

Anti-phishing & 9200 & 400 & Recall at high-risk threshold at least 8500 bps. \\
Marketplace & 8800 & 500 & Sparse seller false-positive rate below 300 bps. \\
Agent payments & 9400 & 300 & Zero known out-of-scope payment approvals in red-team set. \\
Open-source & 8600 & 500 & Maintainer-drift false-positive review below 200 bps. \\
Professional identity & 8400 & 500 & Public negative label reversal rate below 100 bps. \\
Customer support & 9000 & 400 & Org-delegation verification false negative below 100 bps. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Red-Team Matrix}

A production scorer MUST be evaluated against:

\begin{itemize}
    \item dense Sybil receipt farms,
    \item slow-aged farms,
    \item purchased aged identities,
    \item compromised old identities,
    \item false positive attacks on sparse legitimate users,
    \item malicious negative attestations,
    \item issuer collusion,
    \item model poisoning,
    \item relay equivocation attempts,
    \item privacy correlation attempts,
    \item agent delegation bypass attempts.

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Honest Receipt Incentives}

Receipt value should reward quality, not raw count:

\begin{equation}
ReceiptValue_{ij}=\omega_c\cdot r_{ij}\cdot D_i\cdot D_j\cdot Q_j\cdot d_c(t-\tau)\cdot AppealState.
\end{equation}

This makes closed-cluster receipt farming asymptotically low value:

\begin{equation}
\lim_{InternalRatio(C)\rightarrow1}MarginalTrustGain(e_{internal})=0.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Spam Cost Model}

\begin{equation}
Profit_{spam}=N\cdot p_{success}\cdot V_{victim}-C_{message}-C_{identity}-C_{receipt}-C_{attestation}-p_{detect}Penalty.
\end{equation}

The protocol should reduce \(p_{success}\), increase \(C_{identity}\), increase \(C_{receipt}\), and increase \(p_{detect}\) without imposing excessive costs on legitimate new users.

\subsection{Sybil Farming Economics}

A farm strategy \(\mathcal{S}\) succeeds if it reaches a target domain threshold:

\begin{equation}
Success(\mathcal{S})=\mathbb{I}[S_i^d\geq \theta_d \land q_i\geq q_d].
\end{equation}

Expected attack ROI:

\begin{equation}
ROI(\mathcal{S})=\frac{P(Success)\cdot Benefit-Cost(\mathcal{S})-P(Detected)\cdot Penalty}{Cost(\mathcal{S})+\varepsilon}.
\end{equation}

A model promotion gate SHOULD require \(ROI(\mathcal{S})<0\) for reference attack profiles in high-risk domains.

\subsection{Reputation Laundering}

For an aged identity sold at price \(P_{sale}\):

\begin{equation}
Profit_{launder}=P_{sale}+AttackBenefit-C_{aging}-C_{receipts}-C_{attestations}-P_{drift}Penalty.
\end{equation}

Defenses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item ownership-sensitive key-change windows,
    \item value-based step-up checks,
    \item post-sale graph drift detection,
    \item attestation revalidation after control change,
    \item local relationship preservation so a new controller cannot inherit private trust automatically.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Negative Claim Abuse}

\begin{equation}
Cost_{bad\_negative}=P_{appeal\_success}\cdot Penalty+ReputationLoss+AuditCost+LegalRisk.
\end{equation}

The system is robust only if:

\begin{equation}
Cost_{bad\_negative}>Benefit_{sabotage}.
\end{equation}

Therefore public negative claims require high issuer quality, evidence commitment, expiration, appeal, and reversal tracking.

\section{Formal Security Model}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Assumptions}

The protocol relies on:

\begin{itemize}
    \item existential unforgeability of declared signature schemes,
    \item collision and preimage resistance of declared hashes,
    \item soundness of Merkle inclusion and consistency proofs,
    \item finality assumptions of settlement backends,
    \item secure key custody or timely revocation after compromise,
    \item at least one honest auditor or verifier observing public equivocation,
    \item honest execution of local client privacy controls,
    \item transparent provider governance for scoring outputs.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Adversary Capabilities}

The adversary may create unlimited identities, generate arbitrary content, collude among identities, compromise keys, delay relay submissions, attempt log equivocation, corrupt weak issuers, poison model training data, submit malicious negative claims, exploit public timing leakage, and attempt agent delegation bypass.

The adversary cannot forge signatures for uncompromised keys, find hash collisions, or rewrite finalized checkpoints without violating stated assumptions.

\subsection{Security Games}

\begin{longtable}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} p{0.34\textwidth} p{0.30\textwidth}}
\toprule
Game & Adversary Goal & Win Condition \\
\midrule
Origin forgery & Create valid event for uncompromised key & Verifier accepts signature under active key not controlled by adversary. \\
Commitment binding & Open one commitment two ways & Same commitment verifies for two different contents or metadata values. \\
Inclusion forgery & Claim log inclusion falsely & Invalid Merkle path accepted for a settled root. \\
Checkpoint equivocation & Present conflicting roots & Two roots for same epoch-shard avoid auditor or verifier detection. \\
Revocation safety & Use revoked key after effective time & Verifier accepts post-revocation event under policy requiring revocation check. \\
Unlinkability & Link two commitments beyond policy & Adversary distinguishes same subject across scopes better than leakage budget permits. \\
Delegation scope & Prove out-of-scope action as allowed & Verifier accepts action outside effective delegation scope. \\
Assessment integrity & Forge provider score & Verifier accepts unsigned or wrong-provider assessment as valid. \\
\bottomrule
\end{longtable}

\subsection{Guarantees vs. Estimates}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.28\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Mechanism & What It Guarantees \\
\midrule
Signature & A holder of the private key signed the canonical payload, assuming no compromise. \\
Registry & Key state and provider state according to settled registry facts. \\
Hash commitment & Opened value matches committed value if salt and value are disclosed. \\
Merkle proof & Commitment is included in a stated root if proof verifies. \\
Checkpoint & Root was recorded under settlement assumptions. \\
Auditor gossip & Equivocation becomes detectable if conflicting views are observed. \\
Attestation & Issuer made a signed claim; truth depends on evidence and issuer quality. \\
Trust score & Calibrated estimate of risk for a domain; never proof of safety or intent. \\
Graph model & Statistical similarity and continuity evidence; not cryptographic truth. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Formal Invariants}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Invalid signatures MUST fail regardless of score.
    \item Revoked keys MUST fail for post-revocation events.
    \item A verifier MUST be able to recompute canonical bytes before signature verification.
    \item Public commitments MUST NOT require raw content disclosure.
    \item Scoring provider signatures MUST be checked independently of relay signatures.
    \item Agent action authorization MUST check effective scope and revocation.
    \item Sparse evidence MUST NOT be mapped directly to maliciousness without adverse evidence.
\end{enumerate}

% ============================================================
\section{Agent Delegation Semantics}
% ============================================================

AI agents need verifiable authority, not just identity. A valid agent signature proves that an agent key signed an action. It does not prove that the principal authorized the action.

\subsection{Delegation Implementation Variants}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.21\textwidth} p{0.25\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Variant & Use & Rule \\
\midrule
Simple delegation & Low-risk read-only tools & Signed allow policy, short expiry. \\
Value-constrained delegation & Purchases and payments & Amount caps, counterparties, approval thresholds. \\
Workflow delegation & Enterprise workflows & Project, role, and tool constraints. \\
Subdelegation chain & Multi-agent systems & Parent must explicitly allow subdelegation; effective scope is intersection. \\
ZK-constrained delegation & Private parameters & Prove committed parameters satisfy limits. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Permission Language Requirements}

The permission language MUST be:

\begin{itemize}
    \item decidable,
    \item canonicalizable,
    \item monotone under scope intersection,
    \item parameter-aware,
    \item revocable,
    \item explainable to human and machine verifiers.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Scope Grammar}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
Policy        := { Effect, Principal, Delegate, Resources, Actions, Constraints, Subdelegation }
Effect        := "allow" | "deny"
Resource      := Namespace ":" Path
Action        := Namespace "." Verb
Constraint    := TimeConstraint | ValueConstraint | CounterpartyConstraint | ToolConstraint | RateConstraint | ApprovalConstraint
Subdelegation := { allowed: boolean, max_depth: integer, allowed_actions: Action[] }
Decision      := allow only if at least one allow matches and no deny matches
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Delegation Policy Object}

  "signature": "agent_signature"
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Effective Scope}

For chain \(D_0,D_1,\ldots,D_n\):

\begin{equation}
Scope_{eff}=\bigcap_{k=0}^{n}Scope(D_k).
\end{equation}

An action is allowed only if:

\begin{align}
Allowed(a,ctx,D_{0:n})={}&\bigwedge_{k=0}^{n}Signed(D_k)\land Active(D_k,t)\land \neg Revoked(D_k,t)\\
&\land SubdelegationValid(D_{0:n})\land a\in Scope_{eff}\land Constraints(ctx,Scope_{eff}).
\end{align}

Deny rules override allow rules.

\subsection{Authorization Algorithm}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
function verifyAgentAction(action, delegationChain, parameters, policy): AgentDecision {
  verifyAgentSignature(action)
  verifyCanonicalActionCommitment(action, parameters)

  effectiveScope = universeScope()
  for delegation in delegationChain:
    verifyPrincipalSignature(delegation)
    assert activeAt(delegation, action.issued_at)
    assert !revokedAt(delegation, action.issued_at)
    assert subdelegationAllowedByParent(delegation)
    effectiveScope = intersect(effectiveScope, delegation.scope)

  if denyMatches(action, effectiveScope): return deny("explicit_deny")
  if !allowMatches(action, effectiveScope): return deny("no_matching_allow")
  if !constraintsSatisfied(action, parameters, effectiveScope): return deny("constraint_violation")
  if policy.requireSettlement: verifyInclusionAndCheckpoint(action)

  return allow("inside_scope")
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Proof That an Action Was Inside Scope}

A verifier checks:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item agent signature over canonical action,
    \item principal signatures over delegation policies,
    \item delegation chain inclusion or disclosure,
    \item active time window for every delegation,
    \item revocation state for every delegation,
    \item subdelegation permission and depth,
    \item action, resource, tool, value, counterparty, and rate constraints,
    \item event inclusion and settlement if policy requires it.
\end{enumerate}

For private values, use a circuit with public claim:

\begin{equation}
CommittedAmount \leq MaxAmount \land Counterparty \in ApprovedSet \land Tool \in AllowedTools.
\end{equation}

\subsection{Agent-Specific Failure Labels}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.30\textwidth} X}

\texttt{agent\_signature\_invalid} & Agent did not sign the action or payload changed. \\

% ============================================================
\section{Threat Model}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Sybil Farms}

Attackers create many identities that interact with each other.

Defenses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item diverse counterparty weighting,
    \item community-escape metrics,
    \item trust-weighted attestations,
    \item rate limits for new identities,
    \item cluster anomaly detection,
    \item economic or proof-of-personhood optional add-ons,
    \item decay functions for low-quality internal edges.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Reputation Laundering}

Attackers slowly build reputation, then sell or weaponize accounts.

Defenses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item behavioral drift detection,
    \item key/device continuity checks,
    \item sudden target-community change alerts,
    \item high-value action re-verification,
    \item receipt-quality weighting,
    \item post-compromise recovery and warning flows.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Compromised Identity}

An attacker steals a valid signing key.

Defenses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item smart-account recovery,
    \item device-scoped keys,
    \item revocation registry,
    \item anomaly-triggered step-up verification,
    \item short-lived agent/session keys,
    \item delegated signing policies.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Metadata Correlation}

Observers infer private relationships from public commitments.

Defenses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item blinded receiver commitments,
    \item salting and domain separation,
    \item batching and delayed publication,
    \item optional local-only mode,
    \item aggregate disclosure,
    \item private set intersection for contact verification,
    \item zero-knowledge proofs for thresholds.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Malicious Negative Attestations}

Bad actors use warnings or reports to harass competitors.

Defenses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item issuer reputation,
    \item evidence commitments,
    \item appeal process,
    \item rate limits,
    \item separation of private warnings from public labels,
    \item defamation-aware governance,
    \item human review for high-impact actions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Model Poisoning}

Attackers manipulate training data or graph features.

Defenses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item robust training sets,
    \item adversarial evaluation,
    \item provider audit logs,
    \item model cards,
    \item signed model versions,
    \item shadow models,
    \item user-selectable providers,
    \item local policy overrides.
\end{itemize}

% ============================================================
\section{Use Cases}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Anti-Phishing}

A message says it is from a bank. The \TSL{} client verifies whether the sender's \TrustID{} matches the user's prior verified bank relationship, whether the key is active, whether the proof is included in a checkpoint, and whether current behavior resembles prior continuity.

\begin{warningbox}{Example Warning}
This message has a valid signature, but not from the \TrustID{} you previously used with this bank. The identity is three days old, has no reciprocal receipts with you, and has elevated outbound activity. Treat as high risk.
\end{warningbox}

\subsection{AI-Agent Trust}

AI agents will call tools, negotiate with other agents, spend money, sign documents, and interact with humans. Each agent needs scoped identity, delegated authority, and continuity history.

\TSL{} can answer:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Is this the same agent I interacted with before?
    \item Which human, company, or wallet delegated authority to it?
    \item What actions is it allowed to perform?
    \item Has its behavior changed sharply?
    \item Is this agent connected to malicious clusters?
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Marketplace Reputation}

Sellers should not lose all reputation when they move platforms. Buyers should not have to trust platform-specific badges. \TSL{} makes completed transactions and counterparty receipts portable.

\subsection{Professional Trust}

Founders, recruiters, engineers, contractors, and creators can prove long-term professional continuity without exposing private messages.

\subsection{Open-Source Supply Chain}

Package maintainers and release bots can sign releases, issues, pull requests, and maintainer attestations. A suspicious package release can be evaluated against maintainer continuity, key state, and behavioral drift.

\subsection{Customer Support}

Businesses can sign support interactions. Customers can verify that a support agent is authorized and that a message belongs to the company's continuity chain.

% ============================================================
\section{Killer Demos}
% ============================================================

\begin{marketbox}{Demo 1: The Phishing Email That Fails}
A realistic fake email from a bank arrives. Gmail does not block it. \TSL{} shows: wrong \TrustID{}, no prior relationship, young key, no company attestation, scam-like outbound pattern. The user sees one clear warning before clicking.
\end{marketbox}

\begin{marketbox}{Demo 2: Portable Seller Reputation}
A marketplace seller leaves one platform. On a new marketplace, they selectively prove 500 completed transactions, 2 years of continuity, and low dispute rate without revealing buyer identities.
\end{marketbox}

\begin{marketbox}{Demo 3: Agent-to-Agent Verification}
An AI procurement agent receives an invoice from another agent. It verifies delegation scope, company \TrustID{}, invoice continuity, and revocation status before initiating payment approval.
\end{marketbox}

\begin{marketbox}{Demo 4: Compromised Maintainer Alert}
A trusted open-source maintainer signs a release, but the behavior is abnormal: new device key, dormant account reactivation, unusual package dependency, and sudden outbound maintainer messages. \TSL{} shows a step-up verification warning.
\end{marketbox}

% ============================================================
\section{Product Surface}
% ============================================================

The product surface is only the visible edge of the protocol. These badges, web views, extensions, wallets, and dashboards are reference interfaces for a deeper trust-envelope layer. They should never be described as the canonical \TSL{} application, because the canonical object is the verifiable proof itself.


\subsection{Consumer Badge}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
TSL Verified
Continuity: Strong
Relationship: Known to you
Risk: Low
Why:
- Signature valid under current key registry
- Identity has 31 months of continuity
- 142 reciprocal receipts
- No active revocation
- Behavior consistent with previous interactions
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Caution Badge}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
Unknown TSL Identity
Continuity: Insufficient
Risk: Caution
Why:
- Signature is valid
- Identity is 2 days old
- No prior relationship with you
- No trusted attestations disclosed
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{High-Risk Badge}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
High Risk
Continuity: Broken
Why:
- Key was revoked 6 hours ago
- Message signed with revoked key
- Sender claims to be a known business but uses a new TrustID
- Similar behavior observed in flagged phishing cluster
\end{lstlisting}

% ============================================================
\section{MVP Roadmap}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Phase 0: Protocol Spec}

Deliverables:

\begin{itemize}
    \item canonical object schemas,
    \item canonical serialization rules,
    \item signing and verification library,
    \item event commitment format,
    \item receipt format,
    \item revocation semantics,
    \item transparency-log spec,
    \item verification API.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 1: Universal Proof Link Reference Client}

Build a reference client where a user or agent can:

\begin{itemize}
    \item create a \TrustID{},
    \item sign a message or claim,
    \item generate a proof link,
    \item share the proof anywhere,
    \item allow a recipient to verify and co-sign a receipt.
\end{itemize}

This phase needs no platform integration and no destination application. Existing communication channels simply carry proof links.

\subsection{Phase 2: Browser Extension}

The extension detects \TSL{} proof links and embedded envelopes on common web surfaces. It does not need deep API integration. It only needs to parse, verify, and render.

\subsection{Phase 3: Transparency Log and Anchoring}

Build:

\begin{itemize}
    \item append-only Merkle log,
    \item inclusion proofs,
    \item consistency proofs,
    \item checkpoint contract,
    \item revocation registry,
    \item identity registry.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Phase 4: Trust Assessment Engine}

Start with transparent scoring and explanations. Add graph intelligence only after enough data exists.

\subsection{Phase 5: Agent SDK}

Ship SDKs for AI agents, wallets, and enterprise workflows.

\subsection{Contract Principle}

Contracts should remain minimal. They settle state roots and registry facts. Complex scoring, graph computation, and privacy-sensitive operations happen off-chain.

The wedge should be a problem where trust failure is painful and proof links can work without permission from incumbents.

\subsection{Best Initial Wedges}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{AI-agent verification:} new category, little incumbent lock-in, urgent need for delegated trust.
    \item \textbf{Marketplace seller/buyer trust:} obvious economic value and portable reputation story.
    \item \textbf{Anti-phishing for businesses:} strong enterprise willingness to pay.
    \item \textbf{Open-source maintainer continuity:} developer credibility and viral proof-of-concept.
    \item \textbf{Professional proof links:} founders, recruiters, contractors, creators, and consultants.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Avoid as First Wedge}

Do not begin by asking Gmail, LinkedIn, or major social platforms for permission. They can become later distribution channels. The first wedge should prove value without platform cooperation.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.26\textwidth} X X}
\toprule
Category & What It Solves & What It Misses \\
\midrule
KYC providers & Legal identity verification & Privacy, pseudonymity, behavioral continuity, portability across contexts \\
Password/auth providers & Account access & Trustworthiness, graph behavior, counterparty receipts \\

\end{center}

% ============================================================
\section{Technical Differentiation}
% ============================================================

\TSL{} combines eight capabilities that are usually separate:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item cryptographic identity,
    \item message/event signatures,
    \item counterparty receipts,
    \item append-only transparency logs,
    \item blockchain-anchored checkpoints,
    \item key revocation and recovery,
    \item privacy-preserving graph intelligence,
    \item signed, plural trust assessments.
\end{enumerate}

The novelty is not ``put messages on a blockchain.'' That is the wrong framing. The novelty is:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Build a portable behavioral trust substrate whose evidence is cryptographically auditable and privacy-preserving by default.}
\end{quote}

% ============================================================
\section{Minimum Security Requirements}
% ============================================================

A production implementation requires:

\begin{itemize}
    \item audited cryptographic libraries,
    \item canonical serialization to prevent signature ambiguity,
    \item domain-separated commitments,
    \item replay protection with nonces and timestamps,
    \item robust key rotation semantics,
    \item revocation propagation,
    \item transparency-log consistency proofs,
    \item rate limits and anti-spam controls,
    \item privacy threat modeling,
    \item user-controlled disclosure,
    \item signed model versions,
    \item appeal mechanisms,
    \item abuse review for high-impact labels.
\end{itemize}

\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}


% ============================================================
\section{Engineering Implementation Specification}
% ============================================================

This section converts the protocol architecture into an engineer-executable backend specification. The reference implementation must be treated as a protocol stack, not as a monolithic application. A web app, extension, dashboard, or enterprise console is only a client of the protocol.

\begin{principlebox}{Implementation Boundary}
The canonical product is the protocol: object schemas, serialization rules, cryptographic verification, identity resolution, revocation semantics, Merkle proof verification, checkpoint settlement, relay behavior, and signed trust assessments. Applications are optional interfaces and carriers. No single website, dashboard, wallet, or extension is the protocol.
\end{principlebox}

\subsection{Normative Language}

The following words are used with implementation meaning:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.18\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Term & Meaning \\
\midrule
MUST & Required for protocol compatibility. Implementations that violate a MUST are non-compliant. \\
SHOULD & Strong recommendation. Implementations may differ only with a documented reason. \\
MAY & Optional extension that must not break compatibility. \\
LOCAL & Data or computation controlled by the user, device, organization, or private verifier. \\
PUBLIC & Data visible in logs, registries, chain state, or public APIs. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Decentralization Invariants}

A compliant implementation MUST preserve these invariants:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A valid \TSL{} proof MUST be verifiable without the original hosted website.
    \item A valid \TSL{} proof MUST NOT require the user to join a destination application or social network.
    \item Raw message content MUST NOT be required for public log inclusion.
    \item The canonical event validity MUST NOT depend on a trust score.
    \item The canonical event validity MUST NOT depend on a future token, staking tier, subscription plan, or payment method.
    \item Any compatible relay MAY accept commitments if it follows the relay validation rules.
    \item Any compatible verifier MAY verify signatures, revocation state, inclusion proofs, and settled checkpoints.
    \item Scoring providers MUST be plural and signed; the base protocol MUST NOT require a single centralized scoring oracle.
    \item Revocation MUST be checkable from registry state and signed revocation events.
    \item Checkpoint proofs MUST be portable across settlement backends through a common verification adapter.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Required Implementation Modules}

The reference repository SHOULD contain these modules:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]

    json-schema/

\end{lstlisting}

% ============================================================
\section{Canonical Data and Cryptography}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Encoding Rules}

Every signed or hashed object MUST be converted into canonical bytes before signing or hashing. The reference implementation uses deterministic JSON canonicalization with these rules:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Objects are encoded as UTF-8 JSON.
    \item Object keys are sorted lexicographically by Unicode code point.
    \item Whitespace outside strings is removed.
    \item Arrays preserve order.
    \item Strings use standard JSON escaping.
    \item Integers MUST be encoded in base-10 without leading zeroes.
    \item Floating point values MUST NOT appear in signed core objects. Scores MAY appear as integers in basis points.
    \item Timestamps MUST be RFC3339 UTC strings ending in \texttt{Z}, or unsigned integer milliseconds since Unix epoch where explicitly specified.
    \item Binary values MUST be encoded as lowercase hex with \texttt{0x} prefix or multibase strings, depending on field definition.
    \item Unknown fields MUST be rejected for core object types unless the object version declares an extension namespace.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{warningbox}{No Ambiguous Signatures}
The same semantic event must have exactly one byte representation before signing. If two libraries serialize the same event differently, the protocol is broken. Canonicalization tests are mandatory.
\end{warningbox}

\subsection{Domain Separation}

Every hash MUST include a domain tag. The tag prevents a hash intended for one object type from being reused as another.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
TSL_IDENTITY_V1        = "tsl.identity.v1"
TSL_EVENT_V1           = "tsl.event_commitment.v1"
TSL_RECEIPT_V1         = "tsl.receipt_commitment.v1"
TSL_ATTESTATION_V1     = "tsl.attestation.v1"
TSL_REVOCATION_V1      = "tsl.revocation.v1"
TSL_CHECKPOINT_V1      = "tsl.batch_checkpoint.v1"
TSL_MERKLE_LEAF_V1     = "tsl.merkle.leaf.v1"
TSL_MERKLE_NODE_V1     = "tsl.merkle.node.v1"
TSL_ASSESSMENT_V1      = "tsl.trust_assessment.v1"
TSL_ASSESSMENT_V2      = "tsl.trust_assessment.v2"
TSL_PROOF_BUNDLE_V1    = "tsl.proof_bundle.v1"
TSL_DELEGATION_V2      = "tsl.delegation_policy.v2"
TSL_AGENT_ACTION_V2    = "tsl.agent_action.v2"
\end{lstlisting}

The generic hash function is:

\begin{equation}
\hash_T(x) = \hash(\operatorname{utf8}(T) \parallel \texttt{0x00} \parallel x).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Reference Crypto Suite}

The MVP crypto suite SHOULD use:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Primitive & Reference Choice \\
\midrule
Signature & Ed25519 for local keys and agent keys \\
Smart account signature & EIP-712-compatible signature or account abstraction validation where applicable \\
Hash & SHA-256 for broad compatibility; BLAKE3 MAY be offered as an extension \\
Commitment salt & 256-bit random salt from a cryptographically secure random generator \\
Nonce & 256-bit random nonce per event \\
Merkle tree & Binary append-only tree with domain-separated leaves and internal nodes \\
Encryption at rest & XChaCha20-Poly1305 or AES-256-GCM for local private data \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Core TypeScript Interfaces}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
export type Hex32 = `0x${string}`;      // exactly 32 bytes encoded as lowercase hex
export type HexSig = `0x${string}`;     // signature bytes
export type TrustID = string;           // did:tsl:<method>:<identifier>
export type RFC3339 = string;

export interface VerificationMethodV1 {
  id: string;

}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Reference Data Flow}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
1. Client creates event object without signature.
2. Client canonicalizes event payload.
3. Client signs canonical payload hash with active private key.
4. Client submits event commitment to any relay.
5. Relay validates schema, signature, timestamp, nonce, and key status.
6. Relay writes accepted item to durable queue.
7. Log node appends commitment to shard for current epoch.
8. Log node returns inclusion promise immediately if configured.
9. At epoch close, log node computes Merkle roots and checkpoint.
10. Checkpoint submitter anchors checkpoint root to settlement backend.
11. Verifier checks signature, key status, inclusion proof, checkpoint settlement, and revocation.

\section{Merkle Log Implementation}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Shard Assignment}

The shard for a commitment is computed from the sender \TrustID{} and epoch. For MVP, use the first 16 bits of the SHA-256 hash of the sender \TrustID{}.

\begin{equation}
\operatorname{shard}(\TrustID, t) = \operatorname{hex}_{4}(\hash(\operatorname{utf8}(\TrustID))) \parallel \texttt{:} \parallel \operatorname{epoch}(t).
\end{equation}

The default epoch duration SHOULD be five minutes for production and one minute for test networks.

\subsection{Leaf and Node Hashes}

For an item commitment \(C_i\), the leaf hash is:

\begin{equation}
L_i = \hash_{\texttt{TSL\_MERKLE\_LEAF\_V1}}(\operatorname{uint64be}(i) \parallel C_i).
\end{equation}

For two child hashes \(a\) and \(b\), the internal node hash is:

\begin{equation}
N = \hash_{\texttt{TSL\_MERKLE\_NODE\_V1}}(a \parallel b).
\end{equation}

If a level has an odd number of nodes, the final node is promoted unchanged to the next level. This rule MUST be consistent across implementations.

\subsection{Inclusion Proof Object}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.inclusion_proof.v1",
  "tree_kind": "event",
  "commitment": "0x...",

\subsection{Inclusion Verification Pseudocode}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
function verifyInclusion(proof): boolean {
  h = hashLeaf(proof.leaf_index, proof.commitment)
  if h != proof.leaf_hash: return false

  for step in proof.path:
    if step.side == "left":
      h = hashNode(step.hash, h)
    else if step.side == "right":
      h = hashNode(h, step.hash)
    else:
      return false

  return h == proof.root
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Consistency Proofs}

Each closed checkpoint MUST link to the previous checkpoint for the same shard. The minimum MVP consistency check verifies:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item checkpoint \(k\) includes \texttt{previous\_checkpoint = hash(k-1)},
    \item checkpoint \(k\) is signed by an authorized relay,
    \item checkpoint \(k\) is settled or pending under the declared settlement policy,
    \item no two checkpoints exist for the same \((epoch, shard)\) with different roots.
\end{enumerate}

Auditor nodes SHOULD additionally verify append-only tree consistency and publish signed audit findings.

% ============================================================
\section{Relay Node Specification}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Commitment Intake Validation}

A relay MUST perform these checks before accepting an event commitment:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Validate JSON schema.
    \item Reject unknown fields.
    \item Check timestamp is within the relay acceptance window. Default: \(\pm 10\) minutes.
    \item Resolve sender \TrustID{}.
    \item Confirm signing key exists and was active at event timestamp.
    \item Confirm signing key is not revoked at event timestamp.
    \item Recompute canonical payload bytes excluding \texttt{signature}.
    \item Verify signature.
    \item Recompute event commitment hash.
    \item Enforce replay protection with \((sender, signing\_key\_id, nonce)\).
    \item Assign shard and epoch.
    \item Persist canonical bytes and enqueue for log append.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Relay Response States}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} X}
\toprule
State & Meaning \\
\midrule
accepted & Relay validated the object and queued it for log append. \\
included & Object has a log index and can receive an inclusion proof. \\
checkpointed & Object's epoch is closed and root has been checkpointed. \\
settled & Checkpoint has settlement proof from the declared backend. \\
rejected & Object failed validation. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Relay Gossip}

To avoid one relay becoming the canonical trust authority, relays SHOULD gossip closed checkpoints and signed log summaries.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
POST /v1/gossip/checkpoint
POST /v1/gossip/audit-finding
GET  /v1/gossip/peers
GET  /v1/gossip/checkpoints/{epoch}/{shard}
\end{lstlisting}

A receiving relay MUST verify the checkpoint signature, checkpoint hash, and settlement status before importing it.

% ============================================================
\section{API Specification}
% ============================================================

All hosted APIs are wrappers around protocol libraries. A proof that requires the hosted API to be trusted is not a valid decentralized proof.

\subsection{HTTP Conventions}

\begin{itemize}
    \item All requests and responses use \texttt{application/json} unless returning canonical bytes.
    \item Idempotent submission SHOULD use \texttt{Idempotency-Key}.
    \item API errors use a standard \texttt{error.code}, \texttt{error.message}, and optional \texttt{error.details}.
    \item Verifier endpoints MUST return enough information for the client to independently recompute verification.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Canonical Error-Code Registry}

Every API and verifier library MUST return canonical machine-readable error codes. User-facing copy MAY be localized, but the code, source layer, fatality, and retryability semantics MUST remain stable.

\section{Verifier Implementation}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Pure Verification Algorithm}

The verifier MUST be implementable as a pure library with no trusted network call. Network calls can fetch missing state, but fetched data must be independently verified.

\subsubsection{Settlement Evidence Policy}

\TSL{} supports two settlement evidence kinds:

\begin{description}
    \item[\texttt{rpc\_attested\_receipt}] An operational or release-candidate evidence object derived from one or more RPC providers. It MUST remain labeled as RPC-attested evidence and MUST NOT be represented as a full offline cryptographic proof.
    \item[\texttt{offline\_receipt\_log\_proof}] A mainnet-grade evidence object that can be verified from bundle-carried data without trusted live network calls.
\end{description}

When verifier policy requires mainnet-grade settlement, the verifier MUST require \texttt{offline\_receipt\_log\_proof} or a separately approved finality-oracle evidence type. The offline proof MUST bind:

\begin{itemize}
    \item chain ID;
    \item contract address;
    \item transaction hash;
    \item block hash and block number;
    \item canonical block header or approved header commitment;
    \item receipt root;
    \item transaction index;
    \item receipt RLP or canonical receipt encoding;
    \item receipt trie proof nodes;
    \item receipt status;
    \item emitted checkpoint event topic/hash;
    \item emitted checkpoint event fields;
    \item log index;
    \item checkpoint identity hash;
    \item contract checkpoint fields hash;
    \item submitter;
    \item finality or source proof.
\end{itemize}

For Base mainnet, the production target is chain ID \texttt{8453}. The checkpoint registry, revocation registry, TrustID registry, provider registry, and governance registry addresses MUST be recorded as deployment evidence before \texttt{TSL-MAINNET}. A Base receipt/log proof MUST be bound to an accepted finality source, such as an L1-finalized source commitment or another approved finality mechanism. Until this proof path is implemented and vector-tested, RPC-attested receipts MAY be used only for RC or testnet evidence.

\subsubsection{RPC-Attested Receipt Policy}

When \texttt{rpc\_attested\_receipt} is allowed by verifier policy, it SHOULD include at least two independent RPC responses when practical. The evidence MUST bind provider/source commitment, chain ID, block hash, transaction hash, receipt status, contract address, event topic, checkpoint identity hash, and contract field hash. Mismatched RPC responses MUST be rejected or surfaced as settlement ambiguity. RPC-attested evidence is not sufficient by itself for \texttt{TSL-MAINNET}.

\subsubsection{Algorithm Pseudocode}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
function verifyTSL(input, policy): VerificationResult {
  result = new VerificationResult()

  key = identity.getKey(input.envelope.signing_key_id)

  result.key_found = key != null

  result.checkpoint_settled = verifySettlement(input.checkpoint)

  return result.finalize(policy)
}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Verification Result Semantics}

A result can be cryptographically valid but not trusted. The implementation MUST separate these states:

\begin{center}
\small
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\raggedright\arraybackslash}p{0.30\textwidth} X}
\toprule
\textbf{Field} & \textbf{Meaning} \\
\midrule
\path|cryptographic_validity| & Signature, key, commitment, inclusion, checkpoint, and revocation checks. \\
\path|content_match| & Raw disclosed content matches the commitment. Optional when content is undisclosed. \\
\path|settlement_status| & Whether checkpoint is settled, pending, or unavailable. \\
\path|risk_assessment| & Optional signed scoring result. Not required for cryptographic validity. \\
\path|verdict| & Human-facing summary generated from policy and checks. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

% ============================================================
\section{Smart Contract Implementation}
% ============================================================

Contracts settle registry facts and checkpoint roots. They do not compute trust scores and do not store raw messages.

\subsection{Checkpoint Registry Storage}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
struct Checkpoint {
    uint64 epochStartMs;
    uint32 epochDurationMs;
    bytes32 shard;
    bytes32 eventRoot;
    bytes32 receiptRoot;
    bytes32 attestationRoot;
    bytes32 revocationRoot;
    uint64 eventCount;
    uint64 receiptCount;
    bytes32 previousCheckpoint;
    bytes32 relayId;
    uint64 submittedAt;
}

mapping(bytes32 => Checkpoint) public checkpointsByHash;
mapping(bytes32 => bytes32) public checkpointHashByEpochShard;
\end{lstlisting}

The key for \texttt{checkpointHashByEpochShard} is:

\begin{equation}
K = \hash(\operatorname{uint64be}(epochStartMs) \parallel shard).
\end{equation}

\subsection{Checkpoint Submission}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
function submitCheckpoint(CheckpointInput calldata input, bytes calldata relaySignature) external {
    require(isAuthorizedRelay(input.relayId), "UNAUTHORIZED_RELAY");

    bytes32 key = keccak256(abi.encodePacked(input.epochStartMs, input.shard));
    require(checkpointHashByEpochShard[key] == bytes32(0), "CHECKPOINT_EXISTS");

    bytes32 checkpointHash = hashCheckpoint(input);
    require(verifyRelaySignature(input.relayId, checkpointHash, relaySignature), "BAD_RELAY_SIG");

    checkpointsByHash[checkpointHash] = Checkpoint({
        epochStartMs: input.epochStartMs,
        epochDurationMs: input.epochDurationMs,
        shard: input.shard,
        eventRoot: input.eventRoot,
        receiptRoot: input.receiptRoot,
        attestationRoot: input.attestationRoot,
        revocationRoot: input.revocationRoot,
        eventCount: input.eventCount,
        receiptCount: input.receiptCount,
        previousCheckpoint: input.previousCheckpoint,
        relayId: input.relayId,
        submittedAt: uint64(block.timestamp)
    });

    checkpointHashByEpochShard[key] = checkpointHash;
    emit CheckpointSubmitted(checkpointHash, input.epochStartMs, input.shard, input.eventRoot);
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Token-Free Core}

Core contracts MUST NOT require a native token. Fee policy, staking, rewards, and governance may be added through separate modules.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
interface IFeePolicy {
    function authorizeAction(address actor, bytes32 actionType, bytes32 actionId) external returns (bool);
}

interface IRelayStakingPolicy {
    function isAuthorizedRelay(bytes32 relayId) external view returns (bool);
}
\end{lstlisting}

The default MVP policy MAY be an allowlist or multisig-controlled relay registry. A later token-based policy can replace it without changing event commitments, receipts, Merkle proofs, or verification rules.

% ============================================================
\section{Identity Resolution and Revocation}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Resolution Algorithm}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
function resolveTrustID(trustId, atTime): ResolvedIdentity {
  method = parseMethod(trustId)
  doc = methodResolver(method).resolve(trustId)
  registryState = settlementBackend.getIdentityState(trustId)
  revocations = settlementBackend.getRevocations(trustId)

  activeKeys = []
  for key in doc.verification_methods:
    if key.created_at <= atTime and (key.expires_at is null or atTime < key.expires_at):
      if not isRevoked(key, revocations, atTime):
        activeKeys.append(key)

  return { trust_id: trustId, document: doc, active_keys: activeKeys, revocations }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Revocation Precedence}

Revocation MUST take precedence over local cache, stale identity documents, or old proofs. If a key is revoked effective at time \(t_r\), then:

\begin{itemize}
    \item events signed before \(t_r\) MAY remain historically valid,
    \item events signed at or after \(t_r\) MUST fail key validity,
    \item clients SHOULD show compromise warnings for a configurable window before \(t_r\) if the revocation reason is compromise.
\end{itemize}

% ============================================================
\section{Scoring Provider Implementation}
% ============================================================

Scoring is optional and signed. It must not be required for protocol verification.

\subsection{Feature Extraction Contract}

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
export interface FeatureExtractor {
  extract(input: {
    subject: TrustID;
    verifiedEvents: VerifiedEventSummary[];
    verifiedReceipts: VerifiedReceiptSummary[];
    attestations: VerifiedAttestationSummary[];
    revocationState: RevocationSummary;
    localContext?: LocalVerifierContext;
  }): Promise<FeatureVectorV1>;
}

export interface FeatureVectorV1 {
  type: "tsl.feature_vector.v1";
  subject: TrustID;
  computed_at: RFC3339;
  identity_age_days: number;
  active_key_age_days: number;
  signed_event_count: number;
  reciprocal_receipt_count: number;
  unique_counterparty_count: number;
  trusted_neighbor_ratio_bps: number;
  attestation_quality_bps: number;
  temporal_consistency_bps: number;
  revocation_risk_bps: number;
  local_relationship_bps?: number;
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Reference Score}

Scores SHOULD be stored as integer basis points from \(0\) to \(10000\).

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
score_bps =
  2000 * crypto_validity_bps / 10000 +
  1500 * identity_age_bps / 10000 +
  1500 * reciprocity_bps / 10000 +
  1500 * trusted_neighbor_ratio_bps / 10000 +
  1000 * receipt_quality_bps / 10000 +
  1000 * attestation_quality_bps / 10000 +
  1000 * temporal_consistency_bps / 10000 +
   500 * local_relationship_bps / 10000
\end{lstlisting}

The signed assessment MUST include the model version, feature disclosure policy, evidence commitment, expiration, and provider signature.

% ============================================================
\section{Security, Abuse Controls, and Rate Limits}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Replay Protection}

Relays MUST reject duplicate \((sender, signing\_key\_id, nonce)\). Clients MUST generate a new 256-bit random nonce for every event.

\subsection{Rate Limits}

Recommended MVP limits:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.28\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Actor / Action & Default Limit \\
\midrule
New identity event submissions & 100 per hour until identity has settled checkpoint history. \\
Established identity submissions & 10,000 per hour, adjustable by relay policy. \\
Negative public attestations & 10 per day per issuer, stricter for low-continuity issuers. \\
Proof requests & 1,000 per hour per IP or API key for hosted API; unlimited for local verification. \\
Checkpoint submissions & One per relay per epoch-shard. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Negative Attestation Controls}

A public negative attestation MUST include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item issuer identity,
    \item subject identity,
    \item claim class,
    \item evidence commitment,
    \item expiration,
    \item appeal pointer or policy pointer,
    \item issuer signature.
\end{itemize}

The protocol SHOULD distinguish \texttt{private\_warning}, \texttt{provider\_risk\_flag}, and \texttt{public\_negative\_claim}.

\subsection{Privacy Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Receiver identities SHOULD be blinded by default.
    \item Content commitments MUST use salts unless the content is intentionally public.
    \item Metadata commitments MUST use salts.
    \item Public logs MUST NOT include raw platform identifiers by default.
    \item Clients MUST warn users before disclosing raw messages or exact counterparties.
\end{enumerate}

\end{lstlisting}

% ============================================================
\section{Test Vectors and Compliance}
% ============================================================

A compliant implementation MUST pass canonicalization, hashing, signature, Merkle, and verification test vectors.

\subsection{Canonicalization Test}

These two objects MUST canonicalize to identical bytes:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{"b":2,"a":1}
{
  "a": 1,
  "b": 2
}
\end{lstlisting}

Expected canonical form:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{"a":1,"b":2}
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Deterministic Event Test Vector}

The following vector fixes a seed, payload, canonical form, signature, commitment, and single-leaf Merkle root. Implementations MUST reproduce these values when using the reference suite.

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
private_key_seed_hex:
000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f

Canonical unsigned event payload:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]

\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{End-to-End Test Scenario}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Generate identity from deterministic test seed.
    \item Create event commitment with fixed nonce and timestamp.
    \item Canonicalize event without signature.
    \item Sign event hash.
    \item Compute commitment hash.
    \item Append to Merkle tree.
    \item Generate inclusion proof.
    \item Build checkpoint.
    \item Verify signature, key state, inclusion proof, checkpoint, and revocation state.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Compliance Matrix}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.28\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Requirement & Test \\
\midrule
Canonical serialization & Same object with reordered keys produces same bytes. \\
Signature verification & Known vector signature verifies; altered field fails. \\
Replay protection & Duplicate sender/key/nonce is rejected. \\
Revocation & Event after effective revocation fails. \\
Merkle proof & Inclusion proof verifies against root; altered leaf fails. \\
Checkpoint conflict & Two roots for same epoch-shard trigger audit finding. \\
Privacy & Raw message absent from public commitment and checkpoint tables. \\
Token independence & Event validity tests pass with no fee policy or token module. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

% ============================================================
\section{Token Compatibility Without Token Dependency}
% ============================================================

\TSL{} is token-compatible but not token-dependent. The core protocol MUST work without a native token. A future token MAY coordinate relay staking, auditor rewards, provider bonds, proof-generation fees, grants, and governance. Token ownership MUST NOT be interpreted as trustworthiness.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.28\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Layer & Token Relationship \\
\midrule
Core trust layer & No token dependency. Events, receipts, revocations, proofs, and verification remain valid without token logic. \\
Settlement layer & May use existing chain gas or sponsored submission. \\
Economic layer & May later add fiat, credits, stablecoins, or native token fees. \\
Governance layer & May later add token voting, but protocol safety should retain security-council emergency controls. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

A future token module must be added as a separate adapter:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
export interface EconomicsAdapter {
  quote(action: MeteredAction): Promise<Quote>;
  authorize(actor: TrustID, action: MeteredAction, quote: Quote): Promise<Authorization>;
  settle(authorization: Authorization): Promise<UsageReceipt>;
}
\end{lstlisting}

The verifier MUST NOT check token balances when determining cryptographic validity.


% ============================================================
\section{The Founder Narrative}
% ============================================================

The story should be told simply:

\begin{quote}
The internet used to trust accounts. Then it trusted platforms. Now AI can fake both the content and the account layer. The only thing that remains expensive to fake is continuity: a long-running, cryptographically signed, reciprocally witnessed trajectory through a real graph.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
\TSL{} is building Proof of Continuity: a trust settlement layer for humans, businesses, wallets, software, and AI agents.
\end{quote}

\begin{quote}
Applications will not own trust. They will carry it.
\end{quote}

% ============================================================
\section{Appendix A: Formal Cryptographic Sketch}
% ============================================================

Let \(m\) be a raw message, \(\mu\) be private metadata, \(r\) be the receiver identity, and \(n\) be a nonce. Let \(\operatorname{canon}\) be canonical serialization.

\begin{align}
    c_m &= \hash(\operatorname{canon}(m) \parallel s_m), \\
    c_\mu &= \hash(\operatorname{canon}(\mu) \parallel s_\mu), \\
    c_r &= \hash(\operatorname{canon}(r) \parallel s_r).
\end{align}

An event payload is:

\begin{equation}
    e_t = (\mathrm{sid}_s, c_r, c_m, c_\mu, h_{t-1}, \tau, n, \rho),
\end{equation}

where \(\rho\) is the disclosure policy.

The event hash is:

\begin{equation}
    h_t = \hash(\operatorname{canon}(e_t)).
\end{equation}

The sender signature is:

\begin{equation}
    \sigma_t = \sign_{sk_s}(h_t).
\end{equation}

Verification checks:

\begin{equation}
    \verify_{pk_s}(h_t, \sigma_t) = 1.
\end{equation}

The submitted commitment is:

\begin{equation}
    C_t = \hash(h_t \parallel \sigma_t).
\end{equation}

A batch root is:

\begin{equation}
    R_E = \MerkleRoot(C_1, C_2, \ldots, C_N).
\end{equation}

A verifier checks inclusion proof \(\pi_i\):

\begin{equation}
    \operatorname{VerifyMerkle}(C_i, R_E, \pi_i) = 1.
\end{equation}

The final verification result is:

\begin{equation}
V = \verify_{pk_s}(h_t, \sigma_t)
\land \operatorname{VerifyMerkle}(C_t, R_E, \pi_t)
\land \operatorname{KeyActive}(\mathrm{sid}_s, pk_s, \tau)
\land \operatorname{CheckpointSettled}(R_E).
\end{equation}

% ============================================================
\section{Appendix B: Standards Alignment}
% ============================================================

\TSL{} should align with existing standards where useful without depending on any one standard as a bottleneck.

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{DIDs:} \TrustID{} resolution can map to DID documents, verification methods, and service endpoints. See W3C DID Core \cite{didcore}.
    \item \textbf{Verifiable Credentials:} Trust assessments, organization membership, and professional attestations can be represented as verifiable credentials. See W3C VC Data Model 2.0 \cite{vc2}.
    \item \textbf{Account abstraction:} Smart accounts can support recovery, delegated signing, paymasters, and scoped agent keys. See ERC-4337 \cite{erc4337}.
    \item \textbf{Transparency logs:} Append-only Merkle logs and consistency proofs can borrow concepts from Certificate Transparency. See RFC 9162 \cite{ctv2}.
    \item \textbf{Layer-2 settlement:} High-volume commitments should be batched and settled through L2s or app-rollups rather than written one-by-one to L1. See Ethereum scaling documentation \cite{ethscaling}.
\end{itemize}

% ============================================================
\section{Appendix C: Default Product Copy}
% ============================================================

\subsection{Website Hero}

\begin{quote}
\textbf{Proof of Continuity for the AI Internet.}\\
TSL lets humans, businesses, wallets, and AI agents prove they are the same trustworthy actor over time, across any app or transport, without exposing private messages.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Investor One-Liner}

\begin{quote}
We are building the trust-envelope layer for online communication: every message, transaction, API call, and agent action can carry portable cryptographic proof of continuity.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Developer One-Liner}

\begin{quote}
Add \texttt{tsl.verify()} to any app and get signature validation, key status, inclusion proofs, revocation checks, receipts, and explainable trust assessments.
\end{quote}

\subsection{Consumer One-Liner}

\begin{quote}
Know whether the person, business, wallet, or AI agent contacting you has real continuity, not just a convincing profile.
\end{quote}



% ============================================================
\section{Implementation Completeness Addendum: Buildable Product Specification}
% ============================================================

This addendum is normative for implementation planning. The preceding sections define the research architecture, protocol objects, privacy model, trust-scoring science, graph geometry, threat model, and product thesis. This section defines when those ideas become buildable, testable, versioned, auditable, and release-candidate-compliant.

\begin{principlebox}{Architecture-to-Implementation Bridge}
A concept in this specification is not implementation-complete until it has: (1) a machine-readable schema, (2) deterministic validation rules, (3) a canonicalization rule, (4) at least one valid example, (5) at least three invalid examples, (6) a test vector, and (7) a migration rule for future versions.
\end{principlebox}

\subsection{Scope of This Addendum}

The goal of this addendum is not to add more theory. It converts the hyper-specific research architecture into the artifacts engineers need to build the product.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.26\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Area & Required Output \\
\midrule
Schemas & JSON Schema files for every normative object family. \\
Algorithms & Deterministic pseudocode for feature extraction, scoring, calibration, graph construction, drift, Sybil assessment, leakage scoring, and agent authorization. \\
Test vectors & Fixed inputs and expected outputs for every object, algorithm, and failure mode. \\
Versioning & Coexistence rules for v1 and v2 objects, unknown versions, deprecation, and migration. \\
UX & Required verifier states, warning semantics, consent prompts, appeal flows, and agent review screens. \\
Operations & Provider onboarding, auditor onboarding, SLOs, incident escalation, key ceremonies, monitoring, and runbooks. \\
Governance & Open-source scorer release process, model cards, benchmark gates, community review, and alternative-provider compatibility. \\
Conformance & Release-candidate levels so the product can ship staged subsets without pretending to implement the entire research roadmap. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}




\subsection{Normative Consistency Patch v4}

This version resolves implementation ambiguities introduced by the broader v2 architecture. The following rules are now normative:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Signed and hashed protocol examples MUST NOT contain JSON floating-point numbers.
    \item Basis-point fields use the suffix \texttt{\_bps}; milli-count fields use \texttt{\_milli}; minor currency units use \texttt{\_minor\_units}.
    \item \texttt{delegation\_policy.v2} uses \texttt{policy\_id}; \texttt{agent\_action.v2} uses \texttt{issued\_at} and \texttt{parameters\_commitment}.
    \item \texttt{sybil\_assessment.v1} uses \texttt{risk\_score\_bps} and \texttt{risk\_label}; \texttt{drift\_report.v1} uses \texttt{drift\_score\_bps}, \texttt{drift\_label}, and \texttt{action}.
    \item Portable verification is anchored by \texttt{proof\_bundle.v1}.
    \item API and verifier errors MUST use the canonical error-code registry.
    \item Research equations are non-canonical unless translated into deterministic fixed-point algorithms and test vectors.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Spec-to-Artifact Traceability Matrix}

Every normative object introduced in this specification MUST map to a schema file, a validator, at least one valid example, invalid examples, and a deterministic test vector before it can be considered implementation-complete.

\subsection{Machine-Readable Schema Requirements}

A v2 object defined only in prose, equations, or illustrative JSON is not implementation-complete. Each normative object schema MUST include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item a stable \texttt{\$id};
    \item a fixed \texttt{type} discriminator;
    \item explicit required fields;
    \item \texttt{additionalProperties: false} unless a declared extension namespace is present;
    \item canonical integer units for scores, durations, timestamps, costs, percentages, probabilities, and basis-point values;
    \item no floating-point values in signed payloads;
    \item explicit enum values for labels, domains, object states, failure codes, claim classes, and governance statuses;
    \item a deterministic canonicalization rule before hashing or signing;
    \item at least one valid example;
    \item at least three invalid examples: missing required field, malformed signature/hash, and unknown non-extension field;
    \item a migration note describing how this object interacts with prior versions.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{warningbox}{Signed Payload Rule}
Signed payloads MUST NOT contain floating-point values. Probabilities, scores, rates, and weights MUST be encoded as integers in basis points, parts per million, or explicitly specified fixed-point units.
\end{warningbox}

\subsection{Schema Skeletons for New v2 Object Families}

The following schema skeletons are normative patterns. The repository schemas MAY add narrower constraints, but MUST NOT weaken these requirements.

\subsection{Executable Reference Algorithm Registry}

Every reference algorithm MUST be deterministic for the same input set, profile version, and clock value. Any implementation that uses randomized sampling, approximate graph algorithms, or nondeterministic ordering MUST declare the seed, ordering rule, and approximation tolerance in the relevant profile.


\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
extractFeatureVectorV0
  Sort evidence by canonical hash; ignore objects failing verification;
  output fixed field order.

normalizeFeatureVectorV0
  Use profile-specified integer fixed-point normalization;
  no implementation-specific floats.

computeReferenceScoreV0
  Integer basis-point arithmetic; explicit rounding mode:
  floor after each weighted term.

selectThresholdsV0
  Apply domain-policy thresholds and adverse-evidence rule exactly.

calibrateScoreV0
  Use signed calibration lookup table or monotonic piecewise-linear mapping.

computeConfidenceIntervalV0
  Use deterministic bootstrap seed from evidence commitment or analytic
  interval profile.

constructGraphV0
  Sort edges by timestamp then canonical hash; discard unverifiable edges.

computeGraphMetricsV0
  Use declared graph profile; report approximation tolerance if used.

computeSybilAssessmentV0
  Use declared adversary tier, cost model, cluster profile, and seed sets.

computeDriftReportV0
  Use fixed windows and robust baseline profile; return insufficient
  baseline when needed.

computeMetadataFingerprintCommitmentV0
  Use scoped KDF, bucket profile, HMAC, salt, and commitment rules exactly.

computeLeakageScoreV0
  Use integer-weighted leakage components and policy thresholds.

verifyDelegatedAgentActionV0
  Validate policy signature, time, revocation, action, resource,
  constraints, and chain intersection.

\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Required Test Vectors}

The following test vectors MUST be added before the v2 object set is marked release-candidate.


\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
scoring_profile.v2/valid-transparent.json
  Assert: schema validates, canonical hash matches expected value,
  provider signature verifies.

scoring_profile.v2/invalid-float.json
  Assert: rejected because signed scoring profiles MUST NOT use floating-point values.

domain_policy.v1/agent-payments.json
  Assert: requires settlement, delegation check, and value-based step-up.

trust_assessment.v2/cryptographic-failure.json
  Assert: contains no ordinary numeric trust score and preserves failed gate result.

metadata_fingerprint_commitment.v1/pairwise.json
  Assert: same metadata under two verifier domains produces unlinkable commitments.

metadata_fingerprint_commitment.v1/rotation.json
  Assert: same metadata under different epochs produces different commitments
  when rotation is enabled.

graph_feature_vector.v1/small-graph.json
  Assert: degree, reciprocity, HHI, entropy, effective counterparty count,
  and seed escape match expected values.

sybil_assessment.v1/cluster-b2.json
  Assert: synthetic B2 cluster produces expected concentration, internal
  receipt ratio, attack cost, and risk label.

drift_report.v1/dormant-reactivation.json
  Assert: dormant identity with sudden high-risk activity produces step_up.

attestation.v2/appealed-negative.json
  Assert: appeal changes status without deleting the original signed negative claim.

model_card.v2/reference-scorer.json
  Assert: model card validates and links to evaluation report commitment.

evaluation_report.v1/promotion-pass.json
  Assert: promotion gates are computed deterministically from supplied metrics.

delegation_policy.v2/invoice-agent.json
  Assert: policy canonicalizes and signs deterministically.

agent_action.v2/inside-scope.json
  Assert: agent action verifies as inside delegated scope.

agent_action.v2/outside-scope.json
  Assert: action fails with TSL_DELEGATION_SCOPE_VIOLATION.
\end{lstlisting}


\subsection{Deterministic Test Vector Format}

Every test vector directory MUST contain a manifest with the following structure:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
{
  "type": "tsl.test_vector_manifest.v1",
  "vector_id": "scoring_profile.v2/valid-transparent",
  "spec_version": "3.0.0",
  "object_type": "tsl.scoring_profile.v2",
  "canonicalization": "tsl-json-c14n-v1",
  "hash_suite": "sha256-domain-v1",
  "signature_suite": "ed25519-v1",
  "input_files": ["input.json"],
  "expected": {
    "schema_valid": true,
    "canonical_hash": "0x...",
    "signature_valid": true,
    "error_code": null
  }
}
\end{lstlisting}

\subsection{Versioning, Compatibility, and Migration}

\subsubsection{Object Version Rules}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Object versions are part of the signed \texttt{type} field.
    \item A verifier MUST reject an object whose major version it does not understand unless an explicit forward-compatible extension rule applies.
    \item A verifier MUST NOT reinterpret a v1 object as v2 or a v2 object as v1.
    \item Minor schema extensions MUST use an \texttt{extensions} namespace and MUST NOT alter existing field meaning.
    \item Major version changes MAY change required fields, semantics, or verification rules, but MUST use a new \texttt{type} discriminator.
    \item A signed object MUST remain verifiable under the rules active for its declared object version and verification time policy.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{v1 and v2 Coexistence}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.32\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Case & Required Verifier Behavior \\
\midrule
Known v1 object & Verify using v1 rules. \\
Known v2 object & Verify using v2 rules. \\
Unknown major version & Reject with \texttt{TSL\_UNSUPPORTED\_OBJECT\_VERSION}. \\
Known object with unknown required field & Reject unless field is inside declared extension namespace. \\
v1 event with v2 assessment & Allowed if the assessment explicitly references the v1 evidence object hash. \\
v2 event with v1 verifier & v1 verifier MUST reject as unsupported, not partially verify. \\
Deprecated object version & Verify historical proofs, but SHOULD warn that new issuance is deprecated. \\
Revoked object version & Reject new issuance and warn on historical verification according to policy. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}



\subsubsection{Concrete v1-to-v2 Migration Examples}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.28\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Migration & Required Rule \\
\midrule
\texttt{trust\_assessment.v1} to \texttt{trust\_assessment.v2} & Preserve the v1 assessment hash as \texttt{legacy\_assessment\_hash}; map \texttt{score} to \texttt{score\_bps = score * 100}; map \texttt{label} to the domain-policy label; add confidence interval, evidence coverage, scoring profile ID, and expiration. \\
\texttt{attestation.v1} to \texttt{attestation.v2} & Preserve issuer, subject, claim commitment, visibility, timestamps, and signature evidence; add claim class severity, appeal pointer, evidence class, reversal status, and issuer-quality reference. \\
\texttt{agent\_delegation.v1} to \texttt{delegation\_policy.v2} & Convert a monolithic delegation into canonical policy fields: \texttt{policy\_id}, principal, delegate, resources, actions, constraints, valid window, subdelegation policy, revocation pointer, nonce, and principal signature. \\
Agent action migration & A v2 \texttt{agent\_action.v2} MUST reference the relevant delegation chain root and use \texttt{issued\_at} plus \texttt{parameters\_commitment}; verifiers MUST reject legacy \texttt{timestamp} or singular \texttt{parameter\_commitment} in v2 actions. \\
Old proof bundles & Historical bundles remain valid if each embedded object verifies under its declared version. A new verifier MAY wrap old evidence in a \texttt{proof\_bundle.v1} container without rewriting the signed legacy objects. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Deprecation Policy}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} X}
\toprule
State & Meaning \\
\midrule
\texttt{active} & New issuance and verification are supported. \\
\texttt{deprecated} & Historical verification is supported; new issuance SHOULD warn. \\
\texttt{sunset} & New issuance MUST stop after a published date; historical verification continues. \\
\texttt{revoked} & New issuance is rejected; historical verification shows a security warning. \\
\texttt{research\_only} & Object may appear in experiments but MUST NOT be required for product verification. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Product UX Requirements}

Trust UX is part of the security model. The interface MUST not collapse cryptographic validity, trust score, and safety into one misleading green checkmark.

\subsubsection{Required Verifier States}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.27\textwidth} X}
\toprule
State & Required UX Meaning \\
\midrule
\texttt{valid\_proof} & Signature, key, inclusion, checkpoint, and revocation checks passed. This does not imply the actor is safe. \\
\texttt{invalid\_signature} & The payload does not verify against the claimed key. Treat as invalid. \\
\texttt{revoked\_key} & The signing key was revoked before the relevant event time or is currently revoked. \\
\texttt{unknown\_identity} & The identity has insufficient continuity or cannot be resolved under current policy. \\
\texttt{insufficient\_evidence} & The score provider abstained because evidence coverage was too low. This MUST NOT be rendered as malicious. \\
\texttt{high\_risk} & Risk model or hard security checks indicate elevated risk. UI MUST show specific reasons. \\
\texttt{appealed\_negative\_claim} & A negative claim exists but has active appeal or reversal context. \\
\texttt{agent\_inside\_scope} & Agent action was authorized under current delegation policy. \\
\texttt{agent\_outside\_scope} & Agent action exceeded delegated permissions. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Required UX Flows}

A production client SHOULD define user flows for:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item first-time \TrustID{} creation;
    \item proof-link generation;
    \item proof-link verification;
    \item browser-extension warning display;
    \item co-signed receipt request;
    \item disclosure consent before revealing raw messages or counterparties;
    \item scoring explanation display;
    \item key revocation and recovery;
    \item negative-attestation appeal;
    \item agent delegation review;
    \item agent action approval or rejection;
    \item model/provider selection;
    \item local-only mode and privacy export/delete controls.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{warningbox}{UX Safety Rule}
A low-evidence identity MUST be displayed as unknown or insufficient evidence, not as suspicious, unless there is affirmative adverse evidence. New users are not Sybils by default.
\end{warningbox}

\subsubsection{Proof-Link Verifier Screen Requirements}

A proof-link verifier MUST show, at minimum:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item proof status: valid, invalid, pending settlement, or unavailable;
    \item signer \TrustID{} and key status;
    \item event class and disclosed fields;
    \item whether raw content was opened or only commitment was checked;
    \item revocation status at event time and current time;
    \item checkpoint status and settlement backend;
    \item optional trust assessment provider, model version, score label, confidence, expiration, and appeal link;
    \item clear separation between protocol checks and risk assessment;
    \item a shareable verification bundle export.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Agent Authorization Review Requirements}

For agent actions, the UI MUST show:

\begin{itemize}
    \item principal identity;
    \item delegate identity;
    \item action requested;
    \item resource affected;
    \item value or cost bound when applicable;
    \item policy validity period;
    \item whether subdelegation was used;
    \item whether human approval is required;
    \item exact failure code when authorization fails.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Operational Requirements}

\subsubsection{Service-Level Objectives}

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.31\textwidth} X}
\toprule
System Component & MVP SLO Target \\
\midrule
Verifier library & Deterministic local verification; no network dependency for already-fetched proof bundles. \\
Hosted verifier API & 99.5\% monthly availability during beta. \\
Relay intake API & 99.5\% monthly availability during beta. \\
Proof retrieval API & p95 under 500 ms for settled proof lookup under nominal load. \\
Checkpoint submission & 99\% of epoch checkpoints submitted within two epoch durations. \\
Revocation propagation & Revocation visible to resolver within 60 seconds after settlement confirmation. \\
Auditor findings & Critical checkpoint conflict findings published within 15 minutes of detection. \\
Scoring provider & Assessment p95 latency under 750 ms for cached feature inputs; expiration enforced. \\
Appeal intake & High-impact negative-claim appeal intake acknowledged within one business day. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Provider Onboarding}

A scoring provider MUST submit:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item provider identity and signing key;
    \item provider status request: sandbox, active, probation, or research-only;
    \item supported domains;
    \item model card;
    \item scoring profile;
    \item evaluation report;
    \item privacy leakage report;
    \item appeal policy;
    \item security contact;
    \item incident response contact;
    \item signed changelog for each promoted release.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Auditor Onboarding}

An auditor MUST publish:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item auditor \TrustID{};
    \item monitored relays and shards;
    \item checkpoint verification policy;
    \item log consistency verification method;
    \item disclosure policy for findings;
    \item signing key and rotation policy;
    \item conflict escalation contact.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Required Runbooks}

The production repository MUST include runbooks for:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item relay outage;
    \item log-node corruption;
    \item checkpoint submission delay;
    \item checkpoint conflict;
    \item relay signing-key compromise;
    \item provider signing-key compromise;
    \item user key compromise;
    \item malicious negative-attestation campaign;
    \item scoring-provider bad release;
    \item emergency model rollback;
    \item schema migration failure;
    \item settlement backend outage;
    \item vulnerability disclosure and patch release;
    \item data retention and deletion request;
    \item privacy incident;
    \item auditor false-positive finding;
    \item high-volume abuse or spam attack.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Key Ceremonies}

Production deployments SHOULD define ceremonies for:

\begin{itemize}
    \item relay checkpoint signing-key creation;
    \item relay key rotation;
    \item provider signing-key creation;
    \item emergency revocation of provider keys;
    \item smart-contract admin or governance key rotation;
    \item auditor key registration;
    \item disaster recovery restore test.
\end{itemize}

Each ceremony SHOULD produce a signed ceremony record containing participants, date, key identifiers, action type, artifacts generated, and verification checks performed.

\subsection{Open Reference Scoring Governance}

The reference scorer SHOULD be open-source and reproducible. The protocol MUST allow alternative scoring providers, but compatibility requires all providers to emit signed assessments using the same canonical assessment object family.

\subsubsection{Reference Scorer License and Release Rules}

The reference scorer SHOULD use a permissive open-source license for adoption, plus a clear patent and trademark policy if applicable. Each release MUST include:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item semantic version;
    \item signed source archive commitment;
    \item signed model card;
    \item feature registry;
    \item deterministic test vectors;
    \item benchmark results;
    \item privacy leakage report;
    \item changelog describing feature, weight, threshold, and calibration changes;
    \item migration notes from prior scorer versions;
    \item reproducible build instructions.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Community Review Process}

A reference scorer release SHOULD move through these states:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} X}
\toprule
State & Meaning \\
\midrule
\texttt{draft} & Proposal open for comments; not used for production labels. \\
\texttt{shadow} & Runs on historical and live data without affecting user-facing labels. \\
\texttt{candidate} & Passed automated tests and awaits governance or maintainer approval. \\
\texttt{recommended} & Default reference scorer for supported domains. \\
\texttt{probation} & Known issue or pending review; labels may warn. \\
\texttt{rejected} & Failed promotion gates or security/privacy review. \\
\texttt{retired} & No longer recommended for new issuance; historical assessments remain verifiable. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Alternative Provider Compatibility}

Alternative scoring providers MAY use different models, features, or weights, but MUST disclose:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item provider identity;
    \item model version;
    \item supported domains;
    \item input evidence classes;
    \item output label semantics;
    \item calibration method;
    \item expiration policy;
    \item appeal process for high-impact labels;
    \item evaluation report commitment;
    \item privacy report commitment.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Model Promotion Gates}

A model MUST NOT become a default scorer unless it passes domain-specific promotion gates. The following are reference gates, not universal constants.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.24\textwidth} p{0.20\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Domain & Gate Bias & Minimum Gate \\
\midrule
Anti-phishing & Low false negatives & AUROC at least 9200 bps, AUPRC at least 8500 bps, ECE at most 400 bps, red-team pass. \\
Marketplace trust & Balanced & AUROC at least 8800 bps, sparse-identity false positive at most 200 bps, appeal reversal monitoring. \\
Agent payments & Conservative & Zero known delegation-scope bypasses, settlement and revocation tests pass, value-threshold step-up tested. \\
Open-source maintainer & Low false positives & Drift warnings use step-up by default; maintainer-change false-positive review required. \\
Professional identity & Privacy and defamation safety & No public high-risk label without adverse evidence and appeal path; leakage report required. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Implementation Alignment and Conformance Levels}

The reference implementation MAY initially implement only a release-candidate subset of this specification. The v2 scoring, graph geometry, metadata fingerprint, Sybil, drift, governance, and agent-delegation systems SHOULD be tracked as separate conformance levels.

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.22\textwidth} p{0.34\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Conformance Level & Required Scope & Excluded or Optional Scope \\
\midrule
\texttt{TSL-RC0} & Identity, event commitment, canonicalization, signatures, proof links, local verification & No graph scoring, no ZK, no Sybil assessment. \\
\texttt{TSL-RC1} & Receipts, Merkle log, inclusion proof, checkpoint registry, revocation registry & No public negative claims, no advanced scoring. \\
\texttt{TSL-RC2} & Reference feature extractor, \texttt{TrustAssessmentV2}, model card, evaluation report & Advanced private graph proofs optional. \\
\texttt{TSL-RC3} & Metadata fingerprint commitments, graph profile, Sybil assessment, drift report & ZK graph distance optional. \\
\texttt{TSL-RC4} & Delegation policy v2, agent action v2, inside-scope verifier & Multi-agent ZK proof optional. \\
\texttt{TSL-MAINNET} & Audits, runbooks, provider governance, appeal process, monitoring, production SLOs, approved ZK ceremony evidence, and mainnet-grade settlement evidence & Research-only circuits optional; dev fixtures never satisfy production ZK. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

\subsection{Production Decision Record}

The following production choices are normative for the mainnet path:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item ZK production requires a new protocol-specific ceremony for the eight required circuit interfaces. Existing development zkeys, local setup outputs, and toy circuits are not accepted.
    \item Mainnet-grade settlement requires \texttt{offline\_receipt\_log\_proof}. \texttt{rpc\_attested\_receipt} is allowed only for RC, testnet, diagnostics, or an explicitly weaker verifier policy.
    \item The default production settlement target is Base mainnet, chain ID \texttt{8453}. Base Sepolia remains the rehearsal network.
    \item Approval is role-bound before it is person-bound. The required roles are \texttt{protocol-security-owner}, \texttt{legal-compliance-owner}, \texttt{platform-ops-owner}, \texttt{protocol-governance-owner}, \texttt{external-zk-auditor}, and \texttt{release-governance-owner}. Before release, each role MUST be mapped to a real signer identity or approval record.
    \item Mainnet approval cannot be generated by code or documentation alone. It requires signed or otherwise auditable evidence for security, legal/compliance, operations, provider governance, deployment, monitoring, and ZK ceremony review.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Remaining Mainnet Implementation Plan}

\subsubsection{ZK Artifact and Vector Pipeline}

For each of the eight production circuits, the implementation MUST provide:

\begin{itemize}
    \item reproducible compile command;
    \item R1CS, WASM, zkey, and verification-key artifacts;
    \item circuit release manifest;
    \item verification-key registry entry;
    \item positive proof vector;
    \item public-signal tamper vector;
    \item witness-shape missing-field vector;
    \item wrong-verification-key vector;
    \item dev-circuit rejection vector.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Offline Settlement Verifier}

The implementation MUST add a verifier for \texttt{offline\_receipt\_log\_proof} that checks receipt status, receipt-root inclusion, event/log inclusion, checkpoint identity, contract field hash, contract address, submitter, and finality/source proof from bundle-carried data. It MUST include failure vectors for wrong transaction hash, wrong contract address, wrong event topic, wrong checkpoint identity, wrong contract field hash, reverted receipt, invalid receipt proof, invalid log proof, and insufficient finality.

\subsubsection{Mainnet Evidence Package}

The production-readiness evidence package MUST include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item external circuit audit or review;
    \item ceremony transcript and participant evidence;
    \item verification-key registry approval;
    \item security audit and finding tracker;
    \item legal/compliance approval;
    \item operations and incident-response approval;
    \item deployment addresses and environment proof;
    \item monitoring and SLO evidence;
    \item provider-governance approval;
    \item final release-governance decision.
\end{itemize}

The \texttt{TSL-MAINNET} conformance gate MUST remain red while any of these items are draft, missing, rejected, or stale.

\subsection{Product Requirements Document Annex}

The first product milestone SHOULD be a focused proof-link and agent-verification product, not the entire graph/ZK/scoring ecosystem.

\subsubsection{MVP User Stories}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item As a user, I can create a \TrustID{} locally or through a smart account.
    \item As a user, I can sign a message, claim, or action commitment.
    \item As a user, I can generate a portable proof link.
    \item As a recipient, I can open a proof link and verify signature, key state, revocation, inclusion, and checkpoint.
    \item As a recipient, I can co-sign a receipt for an interaction.
    \item As a user, I can revoke a compromised key.
    \item As an AI-agent developer, I can create an agent identity and scoped delegation policy.
    \item As a verifier, I can determine whether an agent action was inside delegated scope.
    \item As an enterprise or marketplace, I can request an optional signed assessment without making scoring necessary for core verification.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{MVP Non-Goals}

\begin{itemize}
    \item No global social graph browser.
    \item No universal human-worth score.
    \item No mandatory KYC.
    \item No public exposure of raw messages or exact counterparties by default.
    \item No ZK graph-distance proof as an MVP dependency.
    \item No token requirement for core verification.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Security and Compliance Package Requirements}

Before production mainnet or enterprise launch, the project SHOULD maintain the following non-code artifacts:

\begin{lstlisting}[style=tslcode]
/security/
  threat-model.md
  secure-sdlc.md
  dependency-policy.md
  cryptography-review.md
  key-management-policy.md
  incident-response.md
  vulnerability-disclosure-policy.md
  audit-plan.md
  abuse-response-policy.md
  privacy-threat-model.md
  negative-claims-risk-review.md
  agent-security-test-plan.md

/legal-compliance/
  privacy-policy-draft.md
  terms-of-service-draft.md
  data-processing-addendum-draft.md
  gdpr-ccpa-mapping.md
  automated-decisioning-review.md
  appeal-and-takedown-policy.md
  law-enforcement-request-policy.md
\end{lstlisting}

This specification is technical architecture, not legal advice. High-impact labels, negative attestations, automated risk assessments, and appeal processes require jurisdiction-specific legal review before production use.

\subsection{Next Required Document}

The next implementation document SHOULD NOT be another broad architecture paper. The next document SHOULD be:

\begin{quote}
\textbf{TSL Open Reference Scoring Algorithm: v0 Deterministic Implementation + Test Vectors}
\end{quote}

That document MUST define:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item exact v0 input object set;
    \item feature extraction algorithms;
    \item normalization formulas;
    \item graph construction rules;
    \item scoring weights;
    \item calibration method;
    \item confidence interval method;
    \item abstention rules;
    \item label threshold rules;
    \item deterministic test vectors;
    \item benchmark promotion gates;
    \item privacy leakage scoring;
    \item known limitations.
\end{enumerate}

\begin{principlebox}{Final Implementation Direction}
The strongest product path is staged: ship proof links, verification, receipts, revocation, logs, checkpoints, and agent delegation first; then add transparent reference scoring; then add graph/Sybil/drift models; then add advanced privacy proofs. Do not make graph scoring, ZK, or global provider governance blocking requirements for the first useful product.
\end{principlebox}


% ============================================================
\section{Final Summary}
% ============================================================

\TSL{} is not another messaging app. It is not a KYC company. It is not a single reputation score. It is not ``messages on blockchain.''

\TSL{} is a trust settlement protocol for the AI internet.

Its key ideas are:

\begin{itemize}
    \item applications are transports, not trust authorities,
    \item identities own portable cryptographic continuity,
    \item events are signed but content remains private by default,
    \item receipts make interactions mutually witnessed,
    \item append-only logs make history auditable,
    \item blockchain checkpoints make state durable and portable,
    \item graph intelligence makes adversarial behavior legible,
    \item scoring is plural, signed, explainable, and contestable.
\end{itemize}

The internet's old trust signals are being commoditized by AI. The new scarce signal is durable, organic, cryptographic continuity.



\subsection{Release-Conformance Checklist}

A team should not treat this document as one undifferentiated implementation target. The robust path is staged conformance:

\begin{center}
\begin{tabularx}{\textwidth}{>{\bfseries}p{0.20\textwidth} X}
\toprule
Level & Product Meaning \\
\midrule
\texttt{TSL-RC0} & Proof/signature baseline: canonicalization, identity, event commitments, proof links, and local verification. \\
\texttt{TSL-RC1} & Logs, settlement, and revocation: Merkle inclusion proofs, checkpoint registry, resolver, and revocation checks. \\
\texttt{TSL-RC2} & Scoring profile and assessment v2: machine-readable scoring profiles, evidence coverage, model cards, evaluation reports, and signed assessments. \\
\texttt{TSL-RC3} & Metadata, graph, Sybil, and drift: fingerprint commitments, graph feature vectors, Sybil assessments, and drift reports. \\
\texttt{TSL-RC4} & Agent delegation/action: delegation policies, scoped agent actions, chain-of-authority verification, and agent UX. \\
\texttt{TSL-MAINNET} & Audits, governance, operations, incident response, provider onboarding, appeals, monitoring, and production SLOs. \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabularx}
